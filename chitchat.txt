2016-07-04, 3:16 PM - John Rustle: I was downtown, and someone injected me with a strange substance, it made me walk all funny for a while until I passed out in an alley. I woke up in what seemed like a recreation of my bedroom as if someone had only seen it a couple times. There was a strange cellphone next to my ear shouting gibberish at me. I moved my head and tried to sit up but the there was a little man with a green face who held me down. He said in coles voice "you're probably going to want to go back to sleep"
2016-07-04, 3:16 PM - Peter Blackhat: Jon we've gotta come clean with you
2016-07-04, 3:16 PM - Peter Blackhat: That was real.

2016-07-04, 3:41 PM - Peter Blackhat: Yeah, the thing saying that in Cole's voice is FUUUUCKED.

2016-07-09, 9:50 PM - Jacob Myth: like tackle has 12 number but quick attack is 10. but in regular ones quick attack is always first.
2016-07-09, 9:51 PM - Jacob Myth: and what are those blue bars?
2016-07-09, 9:51 PM - Julian Stacey!: That's the bar that fills up during battle, and using an ability depletes one of those little ones
2016-07-09, 9:52 PM - Jacob Myth: ok. so the first move is default and second move is special?
2016-07-09, 9:53 PM - Julian Stacey!: Yeah, you tap the enemy to do a regular attack, and hold to do the special
2016-07-09, 10:15 PM - Jacob Myth: <Media omitted>

2016-07-11, 5:45 PM - Peter Blackhat: Yeah, it's super unfair.
2016-07-11, 5:46 PM - Peter Blackhat: I deserve none of this.

2016-07-11, 6:16 PM - Josh Power: Is puppy monkey baby a real thing?

2016-07-11, 7:35 PM - Peter Blackhat: Okay, I need the collective wisdom of the Minds of Roha to decide which thing I just did is more shameful.
2016-07-11, 7:37 PM - Peter Blackhat: Lying to an attractive woman in passing about my Team Affiliation, or spending $7 on the game to start hatching the three 10k eggs I got today?
2016-07-11, 7:42 PM - John Rustle: Pete, Nicole, 90s night?
2016-07-11, 7:42 PM - Peter Blackhat: At a buds and I work at 5:30am üòû
2016-07-11, 7:44 PM - Josh Power: Hmmm. They're both terrible, but I'd say spending money. No wait! Lying, lying is always worse. Plus, you should have some mystic pride.
2016-07-11, 7:45 PM - Josh Power: Hey Jonny, is Shaw able to install on Saturdays?
2016-07-11, 7:46 PM - Peter Blackhat: Yeah... but you didn't see her smile dude.
2016-07-11, 7:51 PM - John Rustle: Yep! 7 days a week
2016-07-11, 7:52 PM - Peter Blackhat: Telus came to our door on Sat and I lied to the tiny asian woman saying I worked for Shaw to end the comvo quickly so I could get back to D&D.
2016-07-11, 7:54 PM - Josh Power: Dude, so what! You have enough charm to make mystic work for you. She better not have been an instinct
2016-07-11, 7:55 PM - Peter Blackhat: About that...
2016-07-11, 7:56 PM - Josh Power: Ew. You pretended to be a yellabelly
2016-07-11, 7:56 PM - Peter Blackhat: Better dead than Red!
2016-07-11, 7:56 PM - Peter Blackhat: I have a civil respect for Instinct.
2016-07-11, 8:07 PM - Josh Power: Ye that's fair actually. I just can't help but think of them as Hufflepuff
2016-07-11, 8:07 PM - John Rustle: Do you need me to book you an install?
2016-07-11, 8:07 PM - Peter Blackhat: Hufflepuff is fine!

2016-07-11, 10:37 PM - Josh Power: Jon. How about setup and stuff? Like I can rock $80 no prob, but of i gotta do $200at the outset it might be a bit much

2016-07-11, 11:22 PM - Peter Blackhat: Because you're still allowed to be an asshole in Ravenclaw.
2016-07-11, 11:22 PM - Peter Blackhat: And they're the cool kids.

2016-07-11, 11:36 PM - Cole Basaraba: They are also incredibly patient and dedicated.
2016-07-11, 11:37 PM - Josh Power: I prefer the cold logical calculation of Ravenclaw
2016-07-11, 11:38 PM - Cole Basaraba: Which is fair, Although I will say Hufflepuffs are known to be the hardest working...may score a few brownie points.
2016-07-11, 11:40 PM - Josh Power: While I admire hard work, Hufflepuffs probs just have to work harder than all the others because they aren't very good haha
2016-07-11, 11:40 PM - Cole Basaraba: Sounds like something a Slytherin would say.
2016-07-11, 11:41 PM - Josh Power: Hahaha
2016-07-11, 11:42 PM - Peter Blackhat: Cole prefer Hufflepuff.  Entire nation in shock.

2016-07-12, 7:26 PM - Julian Stacey!: Haha, I was thinking of trying to gps spoof while I'm up here. Probably not worth it?
2016-07-12, 7:27 PM - John Rustle: Not if it means you lose your whole game

2016-07-18, 2:02 PM - Jacob Myth: should be back soon though.
2016-07-18, 2:04 PM - John Rustle: Damn, usually it's the DC jack that's lose in that case... would want to take the unit apart, check the wattage on the pins, and re solder/replace. Or you could try finding an angle the works for it, and place something underneath it to prop it at that angle
2016-07-18, 2:04 PM - John Rustle: Usually pushing up towards the key board is the best angle
2016-07-18, 2:07 PM - Jacob Myth: no angle working. got all my stuff onto usb. may just reset it. haha.
2016-07-18, 2:09 PM - John Rustle: Fair, reset isn't going to fix power issues though

2016-08-02, 11:34 PM - Josh Power: I didn't have room for "Salt 'n Vinegar"
2016-08-03, 12:57 PM - Jacob Myth: going to take so long to remove the backgrounds from these images... need solid screen i think...
2016-08-03, 12:58 PM - John Rustle: Are you using illustrator or Photoshop?
2016-08-03, 12:59 PM - Jacob Myth: gimpin. i aint got adobe cloud sub money.
2016-08-03, 12:58 PM - Peter Blackhat: Yeee
2016-08-03, 12:59 PM - Jacob Myth: ?
2016-08-03, 12:59 PM - John Rustle: You can just pirate Photoshop or illustrator
2016-08-03, 1:02 PM - Jacob Myth: that goes against my comp sci ethics
2016-08-03, 1:03 PM - Jacob Myth: lol
2016-08-03, 1:03 PM - Peter Blackhat: Oh fuck off, Jacob.
2016-08-03, 1:03 PM - Jacob Myth: youd pay for my software, right pete?
2016-08-03, 1:04 PM - Peter Blackhat: I'd tell you I did and install illegal software on your laptop.
2016-08-03, 1:04 PM - John Rustle: They totally don't care lol. Theyve publicly said it a bunch of times. They make money off of letting people have the software for free because it reinforces it as a standard. That way when people need to make money off it, they have to have a license
2016-08-03, 1:18 PM - John Rustle: they're revenue wsa 5.878 billion USD last year, im sure they can let you use it for a small project
2016-08-03, 1:21 PM - John Rustle: also, they're like the shittiest company ever.
2016-08-03, 1:21 PM - John Rustle: it's like stealing from walmart
2016-08-03, 1:21 PM - John Rustle: sure it's still technically wrong. but fuck walmart
2016-08-03, 1:21 PM - Peter Blackhat: Schooled!
2016-08-03, 1:53 PM - Jacob Myth: lol. what were the effects you used?
2016-08-03, 1:55 PM - John Rustle: for removing background?
2016-08-03, 1:56 PM - Jacob Myth: sure
2016-08-03, 1:56 PM - John Rustle: background eraser, quick mask, or magic wand tool
2016-08-03, 1:57 PM - John Rustle: depends on quality and complexity of the image
2016-08-03, 1:57 PM - John Rustle: usually just background eraser or magic wand
2016-08-03, 2:08 PM - Josh Power: Big fan of the magic wand
2016-08-03, 2:09 PM - John Rustle: yeah it might actually have magic built into it
2016-08-03, 2:09 PM - John Rustle: nobody knows for sure
2016-08-03, 2:30 PM - Peter Blackhat: Well... there are legends.
2016-08-03, 2:43 PM - Jacob Myth: so do i want cs6?
2016-08-03, 2:44 PM - John Rustle: yeah that's your best bet
2016-08-03, 2:44 PM - John Rustle: pretty sure most of them will just have host file modification
2016-08-03, 2:44 PM - Jacob Myth: going to have to shower after doing this.
2016-08-03, 2:44 PM - John Rustle: Hahaha so dirty
2016-08-03, 2:47 PM - Jacob Myth: what site you use?
2016-08-03, 2:48 PM - John Rustle: i usually just pull from tpb

2016-08-03, 2:48 PM - Jacob Myth: also. fedex lost my laptop. lol.

2016-08-03, 2:48 PM - John Rustle: whaaaat, are they going to cover the cost of a new one?
2016-08-03, 2:50 PM - Jacob Myth: dell is sending me a refurb i guess.
2016-08-03, 2:50 PM - John Rustle: shiiiit, does it come with a fresh warranty on it?
2016-08-03, 2:52 PM - Jacob Myth: idk. ill ask.
2016-08-03, 2:52 PM - John Rustle: good call, sometimes refurbs only come with a 3 month warranty
2016-08-03, 2:53 PM - Jacob Myth: i sent my laptop in on last day of warranty. lol.
2016-08-03, 2:53 PM - Jacob Myth: hopefully they are out of my specs so i can get upgraded.
2016-08-03, 2:53 PM - John Rustle: hahahahah yeah thatd be dope

2016-08-03, 3:31 PM - Jacob Myth: pikachus vacation op
2016-08-03, 3:31 PM - Peter Blackhat: That fucking photographer douche with the Maril
2016-08-03, 3:32 PM - Jacob Myth: is that movie the introduction of dark pokemon?
2016-08-03, 3:32 PM - John Rustle: which one the first pokemon movie?
2016-08-03, 3:33 PM - Peter Blackhat: Not 2000
2016-08-03, 3:33 PM - Peter Blackhat: I think...
2016-08-03, 3:33 PM - Jacob Myth: josh. is it better to magic wand before or after downscaling?
2016-08-03, 3:33 PM - Jacob Myth: mewtwo
2016-08-03, 3:34 PM - John Rustle: mewtwo is psychic only in the movie and first season
2016-08-03, 3:36 PM - Jacob Myth: it shows up in another movie. they marathoned them on twitch. wasnt a good movie. but it had pokemon. so ill give it 8/10.
2016-08-03, 3:38 PM - John Rustle: hahahaha
2016-08-03, 4:24 PM - Josh Power: Down sampling? I'd probs do it beforehand
2016-08-03, 4:34 PM - Jacob Myth: downsample or crop
2016-08-03, 4:35 PM - John Rustle: Use magic wand before anything else. It's best when it has the highest pixel density
2016-08-03, 4:44 PM - Jacob Myth: cool. but then theres so much more to wand.
2016-08-03, 4:46 PM - John Rustle: i usually just adjust the tolerance for it
2016-08-03, 4:46 PM - John Rustle: do it super rough at first
2016-08-03, 4:46 PM - John Rustle: and then slowly get into more detail
2016-08-03, 4:46 PM - Jacob Myth: takes so long...
2016-08-03, 4:46 PM - John Rustle: can you use background erase tool?
2016-08-03, 4:47 PM - John Rustle: might work a little easier for you depending on the background
2016-08-03, 4:53 PM - Nicole Gibson: Yeah totally do that thing with that one first. Computers n' stuff am I right
2016-08-03, 5:02 PM - Jacob Myth: totally
2016-08-03, 8:05 PM - Josh Power: Hey D&D frands, anyone around before 830?

2016-08-03, 10:17 PM - John Rustle: Nice! It takes a little bit of practice. Keyboard shortcuts help a bunch
2016-08-03, 10:17 PM - John Rustle: Hotkeys I should say, not shortcuts per se
2016-08-03, 10:18 PM - Jacob Myth: i was placing points way to close.
2016-08-03, 10:18 PM - Jacob Myth: better to do big stretches then add in more later.
2016-08-03, 10:18 PM - John Rustle: Sure!
2016-08-03, 11:37 PM - Jacob Myth: <Media omitted>

2016-08-04, 8:29 AM - John Rustle: @ashley
2016-08-04, 8:29 AM - John Rustle: Open¬†WhatsApp¬†and tap the Settings button at the bottom-right. 2. Go to Chat settings > Save incoming media > Off. This stops the¬†pictures¬†people are sending from showing up in the camera roll, and taking over your synced Photo Stream
2016-08-04, 2:36 PM - Jacob Myth: so the harder catch rate and increased escapes is a bug.
2016-08-04, 2:40 PM - John Rustle: oh really eh?

2016-08-15, 8:27 PM - Peter Blackhat: Having her sister in-law steal me the original imagesm
2016-08-15, 8:34 PM - Peter Blackhat: So I guess they need to be outlined properly and reduced to black and white.  No idea how much work is involved in that.
2016-08-15, 8:39 PM - Josh Power: I'll have to take a look at the photos, but I can't imagine it'll be too difficult!
2016-08-15, 8:39 PM - Peter Blackhat: Sexy, I'll let you know when I get them and I'll pay ya per page obvs

2016-08-22, 5:58 PM - Nicole Gibson: Also team - Jon already knows cause he was there when I heard, but my Grandma is on life support in the hospital and my mom flew out there (ontario) to go be with her and my family and she really needs me there so I'm most likely leaving tomorrow for probably about a week or so. This will be the last time I get to see her and my brother and dad will be going out there over the next couple days. I'm repacking tonight because my dad's trying to get my a flight asap. If you could watch over the animals for the next little bit again I really appreciate it
2016-08-22, 6:01 PM - John Rustle: Pete
2016-08-22, 6:01 PM - John Rustle: I was kidding, but I will join you

2016-08-25, 10:22 AM - Peter Blackhat: ... great lol
2016-08-25, 11:10 AM - Peter Blackhat: That great moment when you monitor isn't getting any signal from your PC
2016-08-25, 11:11 AM - John Rustle: Do you have it plugged into the gfx card or on board
2016-08-25, 11:14 AM - Peter Blackhat: There isn't an onboard, so the gfx.
2016-08-25, 11:14 AM - John Rustle: Hmm, do you get a POST?
2016-08-25, 11:14 AM - John Rustle: like your motherboards splash at the beginning?
2016-08-25, 11:18 AM - Peter Blackhat: When I get back home later I'm gonna start switching stuff around to see what's up with what.
2016-08-25, 11:19 AM - John Rustle: Just let me know what's happening before you switch things up so I can make sure everything's all good
2016-08-25, 11:20 AM - Peter Blackhat: And nope I'm getting nothing.  Switching the monitor is first.
2016-08-25, 11:20 AM - John Rustle: Instead of that
2016-08-25, 11:20 AM - John Rustle: You should try unplugging the power
2016-08-25, 11:20 AM - John Rustle: Then holding g down the power button for 30 seconds
2016-08-25, 11:21 AM - John Rustle: (power to the pc)
2016-08-25, 11:21 AM - John Rustle: Then plugging it back in and powering it on
2016-08-25, 11:22 AM - Peter Blackhat: Ahh right!  I remember you having me do that when I replaced my power supply.
2016-08-25, 11:22 AM - Peter Blackhat: I should have known leaving it off for three weeks would give it a new quirk.
2016-08-25, 11:22 AM - John Rustle: Yep, sometimes it can just be residual power left on the board. If that doesn't work, try a new monitor
2016-08-25, 11:23 AM - John Rustle: If that doesn't work, pull out all the ram chips except one, and try it that way
2016-08-25, 11:26 AM - Peter Blackhat: Will do.  Getting back from my AM then throwing my camping stuff together in advance, then gonna spend the rest of the day cracking at it to see if I can get some NMS on the go
2016-08-25, 3:56 PM - John Rustle: @pete. do you need a crack for NMS? or are you going to purchase it?

2016-08-25, 7:13 PM - John Rustle: I'm not even kidding
2016-08-25, 7:13 PM - John Rustle: I think it was when we wanted to watch game of thrones and my computer didn't boot
2016-08-25, 7:14 PM - Peter Blackhat: It's okay. I'm going to go put it in Cole's tower to make myself feel better
2016-08-25, 7:14 PM - Peter Blackhat: \#pranked
2016-08-25, 8:02 PM - Peter Blackhat: New video card runs like a dream, but I can't login to steam to utilize it so I won half the battle.

2016-08-26, 4:42 PM - Josh Power: Yeah Jake and I are basically identical
2016-08-26, 4:42 PM - Steph Curtis: I always mistake the two when I walk into a room
2016-08-26, 4:45 PM - Peter Blackhat: I brought up Apple's stupid proprietary screwdriver and just by saying 'My friend Jon' he was like "'What's his last name?"
2016-08-26, 4:45 PM - Peter Blackhat: And yeah, I have been giving Rhys SOOOO much shit, I love it.
2016-08-26, 4:46 PM - John Rustle: hahahahahahah
2016-08-26, 4:46 PM - John Rustle: they know me by the pentalobe
2016-08-26, 4:46 PM - Peter Blackhat: I told him I was going to tell your family I was deeply sorry for their relation to him.
2016-08-26, 4:47 PM - John Rustle: hahahahaha too good
2016-08-26, 4:47 PM - Peter Blackhat: Haha when confirming it was the right Jon, he just touched his ears and went "the tentacles?"
2016-08-26, 4:47 PM - John Rustle: oh man, that's hillarious
2016-08-26, 4:47 PM - John Rustle: yeah, work him to the bone
2016-08-26, 4:47 PM - John Rustle: he could use it
2016-08-26, 4:54 PM - Peter Blackhat: His friend Weston works for us, hence why I gave him a shot.  So yeah, I'm gonna run him ragged and borderline haze him.
2016-08-26, 4:55 PM - Peter Blackhat: I made him wear safety glasses for no reason while signing these protocols for how to jump a car.
2016-08-26, 5:10 PM - John Rustle: HAHAHAHA
2016-08-26, 5:10 PM - John Rustle: UR THE BEST
2016-08-26, 5:13 PM - Peter Blackhat: I've also been purposely super nice to the person we hired him with he is even more aware of the blatant favouritism.
2016-08-26, 5:13 PM - John Rustle: hahah awesome
2016-08-26, 5:26 PM - Ashley!!: Probably why your employees do not think you are "sweet Pete", but I am living for this shit.
2016-08-26, 5:27 PM - Peter Blackhat: You happened to ask the only guy who got it anywhere near as bad as Rhys is going to lol
2016-08-26, 5:28 PM - Peter Blackhat: But they also all know that I'll be the first one there if they need anything ever.  I've given too many long hugs in the office and promises to not tell on their tears.
2016-08-26, 5:29 PM - Peter Blackhat: It's important to know if they can handle me before I leave them to deal with terrible customers.
2016-08-26, 5:30 PM - Ashley!!: That sounded incredibly perverted, I hope you know.
2016-08-26, 5:30 PM - Ashley!!: But nice
2016-08-26, 5:30 PM - Peter Blackhat: I chose my words carefully for comedic value and the mild discomfort level.
2016-08-26, 5:31 PM - Ashley!!: Omg
2016-08-26, 5:31 PM - Peter Blackhat: I have to feed my Impish nature in order to be able to squash it when that's not called for.
2016-08-26, 5:32 PM - Peter Blackhat: So new guys who are slightly cocky are great for letting me run rampant.
2016-08-27, 9:37 AM - Peter Blackhat: Dat Kubo doe
2016-08-27, 9:44 AM - John Rustle: it was so good
2016-08-27, 9:45 AM - John Rustle: so sleepy today though
2016-08-27, 1:05 PM - Nicole Gibson: <Media omitted>

2016-08-27, 5:38 PM - Nicole Gibson: I second that^
2016-08-27, 5:39 PM - Steph Curtis: That's definitely what my first thought was
2016-08-27, 5:39 PM - Peter Blackhat: How did it take six minutes for someone to suggest that?  I PURPOSELY BOUGHT THE ONE WITH NUBS FOR THE COMEDIC VALUE!
2016-08-27, 5:40 PM - Peter Blackhat: I spent an extra $7 and didn't get the blue one lol
2016-08-27, 5:40 PM - Steph Curtis: I really hope that no sex toy calls the little ridges "nubs"
2016-08-27, 5:40 PM - Nicole Gibson: Wait so it is for your butt
2016-08-27, 5:40 PM - Steph Curtis: Pahahahah
2016-08-27, 5:40 PM - Steph Curtis: Dying
2016-08-27, 5:40 PM - Peter Blackhat: No, it's a foam roller for my "muscles" and back and junk.
2016-08-27, 5:40 PM - Nicole Gibson: Heh, sure.
2016-08-27, 5:43 PM - Peter Blackhat: Oh they for sure don't because 'nubs' is just not a sexy word.  But for a fricken roller it totes says that on the box lol
2016-08-27, 5:49 PM - John Rustle: Tantalizing pleasure nubs
2016-08-27, 5:49 PM - Nicole Gibson: "It's all in the nubs"

2016-08-30, 10:27 AM - Steph Curtis: (And my sanity)
2016-08-30, 10:28 AM - Jacob Myth: "Its no good, we have to venture into the depths of her mind. That's exactly where the culprit didn't think to clean their track."

2016-09-05, 5:31 PM - Peter Blackhat: That's what I was thinking.  I'm off whenever I feel like it tomorrow since I run the shift so I'll just check when shizz closes.

2016-09-06, 3:54 PM - Peter Blackhat: I super deserve Pete-level vicious mockery on this one.
2016-09-06, 3:54 PM - John Rustle: I should have just waited for you lol. I'm right down the road from your work. Hopefully a bus driver will take pity on you haha. Usually if you give em a sob story they'll let ya on for free
2016-09-06, 3:55 PM - Peter Blackhat: Heh I'll live, gonna make sure they have what I at least came here for first.  So I can claim it was slightly productive.
2016-09-06, 3:55 PM - Steph Curtis: Pete I'm off at 4

2016-09-07, 11:05 PM - Jacob Myth: I think a side scroller with each layer on a different skews with parallax would look nuts.
2016-09-08, 6:20 AM - John Rustle: Hey, are any of you guys off work today /free around noon? Ashley's gone to Vancouver for a funeral, and Loki's going to be home alone for 8 hours. I was hoping someone could drop by and maybe let him out for a quick 5 mins?

2016-09-08, 12:46 PM - John Rustle: or throwing his ball inside the house works too
2016-09-08, 12:47 PM - Peter Blackhat: I just got your neighbor to take Ceasar in so Loki would actually pay attention to anything else.

2016-09-09, 11:37 AM - Peter Blackhat: I just turned down tickets that were not free from a friend of a friend, does that gesture essentially have no value in the afterglow of Steph's?
2016-09-09, 11:37 AM - John Rustle: Maybe
2016-09-09, 11:44 AM - Peter Blackhat: Also Anna has not left yet, she leaves Wednesday.  I gave her WhatsApp info.

2016-09-09, 12:11 PM - Steph Curtis: What?!?!?! How and why that's so nice!
2016-09-09, 12:28 PM - Peter Blackhat: It was just kind of a general statement of appreciation for you after Cole was talking about your art, I guess?

2016-09-10, 10:53 PM - Peter Blackhat: Thanks, I do it all the slime.
2016-09-10, 10:55 PM - Peter Blackhat: Huh, there's a Stein's Gate game
2016-09-10, 11:06 PM - Josh Power: What the shell are you guys talking about?
2016-09-10, 11:07 PM - Ashley!!: YES
2016-09-10, 11:12 PM - Jacob Myth: I have that slimes gate game on vita, want to play soon. Apparently its a goo visual novel.
2016-09-10, 11:14 PM - Peter Blackhat: I heard the progression is pretty slow though.
2016-09-10, 11:16 PM - Josh Power: Can't tell if that was an intentional pun or not, Pete. I pray it was, and if so: üëèüèª
2016-09-10, 11:17 PM - Jacob Myth: Hollly crap. Was typing a real reply and did not notice. Well done!
2016-09-10, 11:18 PM - Peter Blackhat: *Takes a bow*
2016-09-10, 11:20 PM - Josh Power: Oh shit Jake, was that "goo" on purpose too!?
2016-09-10, 11:21 PM - Peter Blackhat: He said "Slimes gate" too dudr
2016-09-10, 11:21 PM - Josh Power: Well duh, I saw that
2016-09-10, 11:21 PM - Josh Power: Goo flew under the radar
2016-09-10, 11:23 PM - Jacob Myth: Ye threw in a sly one after the obvious one.
2016-09-10, 11:24 PM - Josh Power: Classic snakeob
2016-09-10, 11:24 PM - Jacob Myth: ;)
2016-09-11, 12:11 PM - Jacob Myth: :) my face is smiley :) im just a face :) you guessed it right :) im smiley face :)
2016-09-11, 12:15 PM - Peter Blackhat: That's a slightly strange thing to see from you, Jacob.
2016-09-11, 1:29 PM - Nicole Gibson: Yeah did you get kidnapped
2016-09-11, 1:32 PM - Peter Blackhat: Seems like the kind of thing the dude would leave as the first clue to finding him.
2016-09-11, 1:41 PM - Peter Blackhat: Buuuutttt I just got my PC working so I'm not going to help you.
2016-09-11, 1:41 PM - Peter Blackhat: X-COM 2 is too fun.
2016-09-11, 1:42 PM - Peter Blackhat: Also I named all the dudes and dudettes after you guys so I'll let you know when and how you are inevitably murdered in the pursuit of humanity's freedom.
2016-09-11, 1:42 PM - John Rustle: Haha perf
2016-09-11, 1:43 PM - Jacob Myth: Yeees. I did that in xcom 1. The first few encounters are fun when you just have novices freakin out.
2016-09-11, 2:21 PM - Peter Blackhat: Me too, if I remember right only Cole survived to the end.
2016-09-11, 2:21 PM - Peter Blackhat: You all died like three times in Darkest Dungeon.  Lesson Learned.
2016-09-11, 2:46 PM - Peter Blackhat: I'm giving you the opportunity to pick your own badass alien fighting nicknames now btw
2016-09-11, 2:48 PM - Nicole Gibson: Princess consuela banana hammock
2016-09-11, 3:13 PM - Peter Blackhat: If that doesn't fit, I'm just going with hammock.
2016-09-11, 2:53 PM - Josh Power: Uncle Chunks
2016-09-11, 2:56 PM - John Rustle: <Media omitted>
2016-09-11, 3:03 PM - Ashley!!: PRINCESS CONSUELA BANANA HAMMOCK! Just call me shit bag.
2016-09-11, 3:04 PM - Jacob Myth: XxSHADOWALIENSLAYERxX
2016-09-11, 3:14 PM - Peter Blackhat: Hahaha Jacob
2016-09-11, 3:15 PM - Peter Blackhat: Ashley, I don't know if I want to deploy you into the field.  You can run the cafeteria and tend to the last of the Ferns.
2016-09-11, 3:25 PM - Ashley!!: I was playing into Nicole's friends reference but nobody got it so that's cool
2016-09-11, 3:25 PM - Nicole Gibson: I did thanks gurl üôå
2016-09-11, 3:25 PM - Peter Blackhat: OHHH FUCK RIGHT
2016-09-11, 3:25 PM - Peter Blackhat: I fucking love Lisa Kudrow
2016-09-11, 3:25 PM - Nicole Gibson: Yeah God damn it Pete
2016-09-11, 3:34 PM - Peter Blackhat: I'm sorry, the last time I watched it was on actual TV.
2016-09-11, 3:34 PM - Peter Blackhat: Before Smartphones and Netflix.
2016-09-11, 3:34 PM - Peter Blackhat: Or Colour.
2016-09-11, 4:00 PM - Ashley!!: HAHA OR COLOUR
2016-09-11, 5:55 PM - Peter Blackhat: I got brought Langford Sushi today at work btw.
2016-09-11, 5:55 PM - Peter Blackhat: Gonna be a good day, yo
2016-09-11, 8:30 PM - Peter Blackhat: Cole and JP are currently being carried out of the battlefield by Nicole and Steph.  Just saying.
2016-09-11, 8:30 PM - Nicole Gibson: FUCK yeah they are. \#girlpower
2016-09-11, 8:31 PM - Steph Curtis: WE ARE STRONG BEAUTIFUL BROS
2016-09-11, 8:32 PM - Peter Blackhat: The first time he was shot, Cole freaked out and threw a grenade at Josh.  Then Josh ran off a shot a dude in the face.
2016-09-11, 8:32 PM - Peter Blackhat: They were both ko'd by Snake People.
2016-09-11, 8:33 PM - Josh Power: ....
2016-09-11, 8:33 PM - Jacob Myth: Lol. Sounds like xcom.
2016-09-11, 8:33 PM - Josh Power: Dude I'm right here eating pizza pops
2016-09-11, 8:33 PM - Peter Blackhat: Oh yeah you're all gonna die now.
2016-09-11, 8:34 PM - Peter Blackhat: Maybe this was my fault...
2016-09-11, 8:35 PM - Peter Blackhat: Nicole's dead
2016-09-11, 8:36 PM - Peter Blackhat: Aaaand now everyone is.
2016-09-11, 8:36 PM - Peter Blackhat: Good work team.
2016-09-11, 8:38 PM - Peter Blackhat: Good thing I saved!
2016-09-11, 9:12 PM - Peter Blackhat: Okay that worked way better.
2016-09-12, 4:53 PM - Peter Blackhat: Alright Art Humans, I'm about to leave work for the Wine and Paint thing.  Any advice for brushing those strokes?
2016-09-12, 5:07 PM - John Rustle: Different strokes for different folks
2016-09-12, 5:09 PM - Steph Curtis: Wine and paint thing? ! Whaaaaat? !
2016-09-12, 5:34 PM - Peter Blackhat: I've probably mentioned it randomly by now, I've had the ticket for like... a month lol
2016-09-12, 5:38 PM - Josh Power: You have not, in fact. Ah well, thanks Pete. My advice would be to not think at all about that you're doing and feeel it, maaaan
2016-09-12, 5:44 PM - Peter Blackhat: Dan and his wife invited me with Cara Sartorio, so it's not like a thing I could invite people to.  I KNOW for sure I talked about when it got cancelled the first time because it almost landed on D&D
2016-09-12, 5:47 PM - Josh Power: Yeah you're probs right. Say hi to Cara for me!
2016-09-12, 5:47 PM - Peter Blackhat: She says 'Hi!'
2016-09-12, 6:38 PM - Peter Blackhat: This pub in Fernwood is quant as fuck.
2016-09-12, 6:38 PM - Peter Blackhat: Also I got my canvas and publicly apologized to it.
2016-09-12, 6:38 PM - John Rustle: Fernwood inn?
2016-09-12, 6:38 PM - Peter Blackhat: Yes?  I think.
2016-09-12, 6:38 PM - Peter Blackhat: Right by Vic High
2016-09-12, 6:38 PM - John Rustle: I forgot they did art night there
2016-09-12, 6:39 PM - John Rustle: Yeah that's the one
2016-09-12, 7:51 PM - Cole Basaraba: ...Gentle strokes
2016-09-12, 8:35 PM - Peter Blackhat: <Media omitted>
2016-09-12, 8:38 PM - Steph Curtis: YESSS
2016-09-12, 8:38 PM - Steph Curtis: It's kind of adorable
2016-09-12, 8:39 PM - Nicole Gibson: HAHAHAHAH PETE I LOVE YOU
2016-09-12, 8:40 PM - Peter Blackhat: The fact that one of these brushes is called "The Peter" is making this so great
2016-09-12, 8:41 PM - Peter Blackhat: No one has clued in from my comments that it's my name.  The innuendos are all over the place.
2016-09-12, 8:41 PM - John Rustle: Get off your phone lol
2016-09-13, 12:04 AM - Jacob Myth: https://youtu.be/yfgs9FRD25M

2016-09-13, 12:36 AM - Peter Blackhat: I ran out of time :(
2016-09-13, 12:37 AM - Peter Blackhat: <Media omitted>
2016-09-13, 9:26 AM - Ashley!!: LOL
2016-09-13, 12:12 PM - Cole Basaraba: Beatifur
2016-09-13, 1:24 PM - Peter Blackhat: Sooo if anyone remembers that random super wasted girl I made got home alive that one time... she totally just came into my work.
2016-09-13, 1:48 PM - Josh Power: Nice! How'd that interaction go?
2016-09-13, 1:51 PM - Peter Blackhat: After I had a mild heart attack, did my customer service thang and was friendly and polite without really letting on that I knew who she was.  There was a glimmer of something weird in her face, but no idea if it was recognition.
2016-09-13, 2:07 PM - Peter Blackhat: Also I switched a shift tomorrow so Jenn could have another counselling session so if one of y'all want to scoop me up from work at 8:30 to get the D&D moving, that'd be cool.
2016-09-13, 2:08 PM - Peter Blackhat: I can probably also just get Alex to do it, actually.
2016-09-13, 2:27 PM - Cole Basaraba: Cooooo' Man
2016-09-13, 2:34 PM - Josh Power: Lemme know if it doesn't work with Alex and I'll swing down
2016-09-13, 2:35 PM - Peter Blackhat: Yarp
2016-09-13, 2:36 PM - Peter Blackhat: Also Jon and Steph have proven to be the most effective alien slayers.  Jacob is dead.
2016-09-13, 2:36 PM - Peter Blackhat: Oh and Julian.
2016-09-13, 2:47 PM - Steph Curtis: WWEEEHOOO
2016-09-13, 2:47 PM - Steph Curtis: JUST LIKE REAL LIFE
2016-09-13, 2:48 PM - Peter Blackhat: Do you have a shotgun and a sword in real life?  Jon just uses explosives mostly.
2016-09-13, 2:49 PM - Peter Blackhat: He kind of killed Jacob, but it was to save everyone else.
2016-09-13, 2:50 PM - Steph Curtis: I have an air gun and a badass Masamune   - but I guess it's not accurate.. because I'd probably try to befriend all those sweet sweet alien babus
2016-09-13, 2:51 PM - Jacob Myth: As long as i died on the brink of insanity. All is good.
2016-09-13, 2:52 PM - Peter Blackhat: You were standing next to a tank of gasoline when Jon blew up a building that Cole lured a bunch of dudes into.
2016-09-13, 2:58 PM - Jacob Myth: Feelsbadman. Good thing you saved!
2016-09-13, 3:03 PM - Peter Blackhat: Sorry bud.  I promised myself after I had four guys at rank four I'd stop trying to endlessly save everyone by reloading when I fucked up.
2016-09-13, 3:04 PM - Peter Blackhat: But hey, I'll recruit Jacob 2 some day.
2016-09-13, 4:14 PM - Jacob Myth: I cant wait. Is that game like the original where youre on world surveillance and alien ships fly around and enslave cities and stuff?
2016-09-13, 4:15 PM - Peter Blackhat: Yeah, pretty much.  Except your fighting an established force in the planet instead of an invasion now.  They're integrated into society and there are hybrid mofos called the Advent.
2016-09-13, 4:30 PM - Jacob Myth: Oh. Sounds cool.
2016-09-13, 5:56 PM - Peter Blackhat: Yeah, it's like 20 years after the first.
2016-09-13, 9:11 PM - John Rustle: Anybody kicking around tomorrow during the day to let puppers out?
2016-09-14, 12:15 PM - Steph Curtis: Sorry duder I work!
2016-09-14, 12:17 PM - Peter Blackhat: Didn't even notice this, I'm only just omw to work now.  I probably could have gone over and released the little scamp :(

2016-09-26, 11:29 AM - Josh Power: Dudewhat? Nice one
2016-09-26, 11:29 AM - John Rustle: Jealous!!
2016-09-26, 11:33 AM - Peter Blackhat: It may have strings attached... we'll see
2016-09-26, 11:34 AM - Ashley!!: What kind of strings
2016-09-26, 11:38 AM - Steph Curtis: "I need you to kill a man"
2016-09-26, 12:09 PM - Peter Blackhat: With this girl you can never be too sure.
2016-09-26, 12:54 PM - Steph Curtis: Better be good sushi
2016-09-26, 12:59 PM - Jacob Myth: Cannibal sushi.
2016-09-26, 1:08 PM - Peter Blackhat: Langford, so yeah.
2016-09-26, 1:11 PM - Josh Power: Hope the sushi isn't mushy
2016-09-26, 1:19 PM - Peter Blackhat: Nope, it was fine.
2016-09-26, 1:34 PM - Steph Curtis: So who we Killin?
2016-09-26, 1:34 PM - Peter Blackhat: Sorry.  Just my free time, apparently.
2016-09-26, 1:36 PM - Steph Curtis: Well that's definitely less messy
2016-09-26, 1:37 PM - Peter Blackhat: That'd depend how much fun we'd have in the killins!
2016-09-26, 1:47 PM - Josh Power: So much fun
2016-09-26, 1:50 PM - Peter Blackhat: Speaking of which, Steph kinda killed Jon, Jake resuscitated him, JP carried him to da choppa, and Ashley got stuck in a net and was left behind.
2016-09-26, 1:54 PM - Steph Curtis: Jeeeeesus why did I kill Jon? !
2016-09-26, 1:58 PM - John Rustle: Yeah!
2016-09-26, 1:58 PM - Nicole Gibson: And i was probably already dead eh? The usual
2016-09-26, 1:58 PM - Jacob Myth: A bit late: The funnest part of killins is afterwards when noone knows. You can just chat with friends on whatsapp like nothing happened.
2016-09-26, 1:59 PM - Steph Curtis: O.O
2016-09-26, 2:02 PM - Peter Blackhat: And Cole has developed a habit of lighting himself on fire during sword fights.
2016-09-26, 2:02 PM - Peter Blackhat: Heh and you're not dead, and have never even been injured in your second body, Nicole.
2016-09-26, 2:03 PM - Peter Blackhat: But you shot Jon in the head because he got mind controlled and I fucked up clicking on the guy who was controlling him.
2016-09-26, 2:03 PM - Peter Blackhat: You put your rifle into the back of his head.
2016-09-26, 2:06 PM - Steph Curtis: I'm brutal
2016-09-26, 2:07 PM - Nicole Gibson: Good
2016-09-26, 2:19 PM - Peter Blackhat: You two actually work super well in tandem on any big baddies that show up.  Blowing motherfuckers up with mind powers and robot explosions before they start stepping on people.
2016-09-26, 2:42 PM - Peter Blackhat: Also, does anyone know when Cole is home?
2016-09-26, 2:47 PM - Steph Curtis: Oh HELL yeah we got a teeeaaaaam dynamic!
2016-09-26, 2:51 PM - John Rustle: Dunno at all. I would have thought he had wifi :/
2016-09-26, 2:51 PM - John Rustle: I started playing Lego Star wars today. Actually kinda fun
2016-09-26, 2:52 PM - Nicole Gibson: Oh frick yeah its fun!
2016-09-26, 2:53 PM - Josh Power: I don't think he was even sure! Seemed like it was either a week or week and a half. So likely between Fri and sun
2016-09-26, 3:02 PM - Peter Blackhat: They're all fun!  We never did finish Marvel Lego
2016-09-26, 3:11 PM - John Rustle: Yeah I just torrented them. Pretty decent
2016-09-26, 3:14 PM - Peter Blackhat: I know you did, Jon.  I know you did.
2016-09-26, 3:23 PM - Steph Curtis: Today is the longest day in history. Also my phone just autocorrectes 'longest' to 'lindy'. I'm sorry what?
2016-09-26, 3:24 PM - Steph Curtis: *autocorrected
2016-09-26, 3:25 PM - Peter Blackhat: In history, huh?  That having to do with how work is going at all? lol
2016-09-26, 3:29 PM - Steph Curtis: IT FEELS LIKE I'VE BEEN HERE A WHOLE WEEK ALREADY.  I'm dyin'
2016-09-26, 3:44 PM - Steph Curtis: Nah I'm just hungry and feeling like a big baby.  Gonna shove cheap ramen in my face when I get home
2016-09-26, 3:44 PM - John Rustle: Omg ramen
2016-09-26, 3:44 PM - John Rustle: How did you like bao? You went right?
2016-09-26, 3:49 PM - Steph Curtis: I made the mistake of not getting the ramen
2016-09-26, 3:49 PM - Steph Curtis: It was okay but honestly the dish I had I could have made at home
2016-09-26, 3:50 PM - Steph Curtis: Still good though! Defs wanna go again and get ramen

2016-09-26, 4:20 PM - Peter Blackhat: Deal!
2016-09-26, 4:43 PM - John Rustle: I got it last time, and enjoyed it quite a lot actually. Had a really great broth.
2016-09-26, 5:02 PM - Steph Curtis: Dude mine was flavourless
2016-09-26, 5:02 PM - Steph Curtis: Boo-urns. Maybe different chef?
2016-09-26, 5:03 PM - John Rustle: Yeah maybe, mine was spicy af
2016-09-26, 5:04 PM - Steph Curtis: I'm jelly man. Mine wasn't even close. It was good but like ... not that good
2016-09-26, 5:06 PM - Steph Curtis: <Media omitted>
2016-09-26, 5:06 PM - Steph Curtis: When you turn package ramen into something deeeeliiicious
2016-09-26, 5:06 PM - John Rustle: Yeah no, mine was totally different looking lol
2016-09-26, 5:06 PM - John Rustle: I know they switch shit up like every week so who knows
2016-09-26, 5:06 PM - Steph Curtis: What no this isn't the Mei fun
2016-09-26, 5:07 PM - Steph Curtis: But yeah probably a different thing
2016-09-26, 5:07 PM - Steph Curtis: I'll get ramen next time

2016-09-26, 7:00 PM - John Rustle: Hahahaha
2016-09-26, 7:09 PM - Peter Blackhat: Hahaha wtf
2016-09-27, 10:53 AM - Peter Blackhat: Okay, so as of last night I've got a crucial story mission to do, and I'm sending you fuckers minus Cole because of the lighting himself on fire thing.
2016-09-27, 10:53 AM - Peter Blackhat: So be on the lookout for my announcement of your deaths/maiming.
2016-09-27, 11:06 AM - Nicole Gibson: I'm so ready
2016-09-27, 11:08 AM - Steph Curtis: I hope I die a hero
2016-09-27, 11:19 AM - Josh Power: I can't wait to totally succeed! "I'm doing good in the game, so I'm doing good in life!"
2016-09-27, 11:59 AM - Peter Blackhat: I can only promise that if I cause your deaths by my own negligence, I will never admit it.
2016-09-27, 12:00 PM - Peter Blackhat: Ever.
2016-09-27, 12:00 PM - Nicole Gibson: I hope i kill a team meber by accident
2016-09-27, 12:00 PM - Nicole Gibson: Or on purpose
2016-09-27, 12:00 PM - Nicole Gibson: Whatever works
2016-09-27, 12:01 PM - Peter Blackhat: And if you die you are not getting a third body, no whining!
2016-09-27, 2:13 PM - Peter Blackhat: Before I start working in D&D stuff tonight, I am determined to finish my bird drawing in honour of Zine day.

2016-09-27, 6:03 PM - Ashley!!: @12504808030  is the commodore ballroom a seated place, or is it all floor?
2016-09-27, 6:03 PM - Josh Power: Every time I've been it's general admission, but there are seats around the edges/near the bars
2016-09-27, 6:04 PM - Ashley!!: Oh okay so if it says like "seat 42" it's just saying that??
2016-09-27, 6:08 PM - Josh Power: I do believe so!

2016-09-27, 6:33 PM - Jacob Myth: Actually forget it. Haha...
2016-09-27, 6:33 PM - John Rustle: I'm down
2016-09-27, 6:33 PM - Nicole Gibson: <Media omitted>
2016-09-27, 6:34 PM - John Rustle: We should just post like 50 pictures of cole
2016-09-27, 6:34 PM - Nicole Gibson: Hahahaha omg

2016-09-27, 6:39 PM - Josh Power: Haha truth pete
2016-09-27, 6:41 PM - Peter Blackhat: Me, that's fucking who.

2016-09-27, 6:45 PM - Peter Blackhat: Okay actually I need to stop because it's making me miss him.
2016-09-27, 6:46 PM - Jacob Myth: Yeaa. Maybe post a bunch the day hes back.
2016-09-27, 6:46 PM - Peter Blackhat: That would require us to know when that is.
2016-09-27, 6:46 PM - Jacob Myth: Wait. Does he own sailer moon seasons?
2016-09-27, 6:47 PM - Jacob Myth: I kinda want to borrow those...
2016-09-27, 6:47 PM - Peter Blackhat: Go for it, I have a key to his room.
2016-09-27, 6:49 PM - Jacob Myth: The spirit of 10yr old Jacob would be most pleased.
2016-09-27, 6:50 PM - Jacob Myth: Ill just wait til he gets back though.
2016-09-27, 6:50 PM - Peter Blackhat: Aight.
2016-09-27, 6:51 PM - Peter Blackhat: I may go draw in his room...
2016-09-27, 6:53 PM - Jacob Myth: Maybe draw 50 pictures of cole and hang them in his room.
2016-09-27, 6:53 PM - Peter Blackhat: Nigga, do I seem like I can draw one picture of Cole?
2016-09-27, 6:54 PM - Peter Blackhat: The claw on this bird is literally 12 lines and I can't get it right lol
2016-09-27, 6:57 PM - Jacob Myth: I was going to give a recommendation but then realized im not the art dude. Haha.
2016-09-27, 7:00 PM - Peter Blackhat: I'll take it anyway.
2016-09-27, 7:00 PM - Peter Blackhat: Programming is a kind of art.
2016-09-27, 7:01 PM - Peter Blackhat: ...
2016-09-27, 7:01 PM - Peter Blackhat: Right?
2016-09-27, 7:01 PM - Jacob Myth: Thats a debatable point. Id say yea. I usually draw a bunch of light lines for each line. So the shape become more clear with each added line.
2016-09-27, 7:07 PM - Peter Blackhat: Yeah, been doing that.  My problem is I got it perfect once and then erased it to move it up higher and can't do it again lol
2016-09-27, 7:07 PM - Jacob Myth: Oh. Well shit. Get your focus game on.
2016-09-27, 8:11 PM - Ashley!!: HAHHAHHA THE COLE PICTURES PLEASE KEEP THEM COMING
2016-09-27, 8:13 PM - Nicole Gibson: <Media omitted>
2016-09-27, 8:14 PM - Peter Blackhat: <Media omitted>
2016-09-27, 8:14 PM - Peter Blackhat: My favourite part of the third one is that that was what was laying on the floor under his foot.
2016-09-27, 8:14 PM - Nicole Gibson: <Media omitted>
2016-09-27, 8:15 PM - Peter Blackhat: It seriously feels like we're making his fucking funeral slideshow.
2016-09-27, 8:16 PM - Nicole Gibson: But that's all i csn contribute
2016-09-27, 8:24 PM - John Rustle: <Media omitted>
2016-09-27, 8:25 PM - Peter Blackhat: There we go, finally a normal picture of him.
2016-09-27, 8:26 PM - Nicole Gibson: You have so many more of him on your instagram pete
2016-09-27, 8:26 PM - John Rustle: <Media omitted>

2016-09-27, 8:28 PM - Peter Blackhat: And Ashley, sweety, those are movies.
2016-09-27, 8:28 PM - Peter Blackhat: \#readthatinacondescendingbritishtone
2016-09-27, 8:38 PM - John Rustle: <Media omitted>
2016-09-27, 8:46 PM - Steph Curtis: I don't like that one
2016-09-27, 8:46 PM - Steph Curtis: I don't like it
2016-09-27, 8:47 PM - Jacob Myth: I like how cole was smart and is looking to his left.
2016-09-27, 8:48 PM - Josh Power: Hahaha
2016-09-27, 8:48 PM - Josh Power: Classiv
2016-09-27, 8:48 PM - Peter Blackhat: Hahahaha
2016-09-27, 8:48 PM - Peter Blackhat: Oh fuck that's great.
2016-09-27, 8:49 PM - Peter Blackhat: Anyone have my face swap with Jules?  We just looked like two completely normal people.
2016-09-27, 8:53 PM - John Rustle: Nerp
2016-09-28, 10:40 AM - Peter Blackhat: Okay, for the pre-final mission, I could only send three people to hack this relay tower.  It auto selected me Steph, Nicole, and Ashley, oddly enough, and while I appreciate girl power, you guys needed someone to shred armor and take point so Josh replaced Ash.
2016-09-28, 10:40 AM - Peter Blackhat: Josh did not return.
2016-09-28, 10:42 AM - Peter Blackhat: So the final team is now a Jon, Jacob, Ashley, Jess, and a moderately injured Steph and Nicole.  I will now be taking bets on who lives.
2016-09-28, 10:51 AM - Josh Power: Dammit! What happened to me?
2016-09-28, 10:52 AM - Peter Blackhat: Walked around a corner and there were three dudes right in your face and they all crit you.
2016-09-28, 10:53 AM - Peter Blackhat: It was the last batch of guys too.
2016-09-28, 10:53 AM - Peter Blackhat: Steps robot carried your corpse home though.  Isn't that nice?
2016-09-28, 10:53 AM - Nicole Gibson: Aaawweeeee
2016-09-28, 10:55 AM - Peter Blackhat: And honestly Jessica has like... 117 kills so she's a solid replacement.
2016-09-28, 11:30 AM - Josh Power: Pete, we d&dizzlin' tonight?
2016-09-28, 11:34 AM - Nicole Gibson: I close and coles not here :c
2016-09-28, 11:35 AM - Nicole Gibson: But maybe y'all 3 will
2016-09-28, 11:56 AM - Peter Blackhat: Yeah, I think we probs will unless you want to do some other thang we got in the docket.
2016-09-28, 11:56 AM - Peter Blackhat: Also Steph down :(
2016-09-28, 11:57 AM - Peter Blackhat: And you guys are totes surrounded, and Jon is mind controlled.
2016-09-28, 12:01 PM - Steph Curtis: How did I die? !
2016-09-28, 12:02 PM - Peter Blackhat: A debilitating psychic field, a grenade, and a rocket spear thing.  All just AoE :(
2016-09-28, 12:07 PM - Steph Curtis: Woah
2016-09-28, 12:08 PM - Steph Curtis: ...dang. poor little warrior
2016-09-28, 12:08 PM - Nicole Gibson: Jeez you got fucked up
2016-09-28, 12:10 PM - Peter Blackhat: The area is just so big and these fuckers teleport everytime you hit them, so keeping you guys together is impossible.
2016-09-28, 12:11 PM - Peter Blackhat: All I have to do break a mind control is move Nicole near them, and they're always just barely too far away.
2016-09-28, 12:11 PM - Jacob Myth: I like how youre mini diarying your playthrough on here.
2016-09-28, 12:11 PM - Peter Blackhat: Thank you.
2016-09-28, 12:13 PM - Nicole Gibson: This is like a waybetter version of sims i love it
2016-09-28, 12:14 PM - Nicole Gibson: It's like hearing what you did when you were drunk "ooh tell me more, what else did i do!"
2016-09-28, 12:14 PM - Peter Blackhat: Pretty sure that's how they marketed it.
2016-09-28, 12:21 PM - Peter Blackhat: OH AND JON WITH THE CRITICAL HIT!!
2016-09-28, 12:21 PM - Peter Blackhat: HUMANS WIN!
2016-09-28, 12:21 PM - Peter Blackhat: You guys were seriously all about to die if he missed that.
2016-09-28, 12:22 PM - Peter Blackhat: Well except Jacob, because he was completely unharmed somehow.
2016-09-28, 12:39 PM - John Rustle: Yaaaay
2016-09-28, 12:42 PM - Peter Blackhat: You were panicked and at 1HP, Jacob used his last medical charge thing to calm, you down.  Nicole is bleeding out on the floor from mind-controlled Jess having blown her face off, and Ashley is surrounded by Snake people and at 2HP.
2016-09-28, 12:42 PM - Peter Blackhat: You climb a pipe, aim down at this leader fuckers head.  36% chance to hit.
2016-09-28, 12:43 PM - Peter Blackhat: Feels good man.
2016-09-28, 3:57 PM - Nicole Gibson: Im so proud of us all üíö
2016-09-28, 3:59 PM - John Rustle: So! If any of you folks were hooked up to my Shaw go wifi, it got reset so send me your WIFI MAC address if you need to be put back on
2016-09-28, 4:00 PM - Peter Blackhat: I think I'm using the one you gave Nicole.
2016-09-28, 4:06 PM - Nicole Gibson: Im still connecting to shaw open though?
2016-09-28, 4:06 PM - Nicole Gibson: And I'm connecting & its working
2016-09-28, 4:08 PM - John Rustle: That's for your WIFI youre fine
2016-09-28, 4:11 PM - Nicole Gibson: Okay dope üëç
2016-09-28, 4:13 PM - Peter Blackhat: In other news, finished two maps for the future, totally forgot to start the map for today!  Woo!
2016-09-28, 4:17 PM - Josh Power: Wait so does that mean we are dizzlin' tonight?
2016-09-28, 4:19 PM - Peter Blackhat: I'm prepared to for sure, as are Steve and Alex.
2016-09-28, 4:19 PM - Peter Blackhat: Just lamenting to my poor planning lol
2016-09-28, 4:22 PM - Josh Power: Okay most good. I'm supes down. Even with Nicole closing, we probably will have barely gotten started by the time she's home
2016-09-28, 4:24 PM - Peter Blackhat: Haha maybe
2016-09-28, 4:32 PM - Nicole Gibson: Yeah ill be home like 9:45
2016-09-28, 4:36 PM - Peter Blackhat: Just in time for Astor's funeral to he over.
2016-09-28, 4:36 PM - Nicole Gibson: I hate you
2016-09-28, 4:37 PM - Peter Blackhat: I am merely the arbiter of the decisions fictional beings make through me.
2016-09-28, 4:38 PM - Peter Blackhat: Sometimes that involved hurting your bear buddy
2016-09-28, 4:39 PM - Peter Blackhat: Who also has different stats I should probably give you after his encounter with Papa Hannity
2016-09-28, 4:50 PM - Nicole Gibson: Oh
2016-09-29, 8:49 AM - Jacob Myth: Tfw you realize bus mustve gone by more than 5 mins early. ¬∞n¬∞
2016-09-29, 8:53 AM - Josh Power: Guuuuh
2016-09-29, 8:53 AM - Josh Power: Sucks
2016-09-29, 8:55 AM - Jacob Myth: Leave earlier and still get slammed. Im sure that bus driver is maniacally laughing this very moment.
2016-09-29, 8:56 AM - Josh Power: Oh definitely. He probably also drank all the cream at the coffee shop so I had to use milk in my coff
2016-09-29, 8:57 AM - Josh Power: What a fuck

2016-09-29, 9:54 AM - John Rustle: Filthy commoners
2016-09-29, 9:54 AM - Peter Blackhat: Haha you get sick like two days a year.
2016-09-29, 9:55 AM - Peter Blackhat: And I always get sick like a day after you're fine.
2016-09-29, 9:55 AM - Peter Blackhat: It is written.
2016-09-29, 9:55 AM - Josh Power: Dude Pete I left work at 145 this morning, overslept and didn't get back til 745
2016-09-29, 9:55 AM - Josh Power: A little later than I hoped
2016-09-29, 9:57 AM - Steph Curtis: Jeeeeesus what? !
2016-09-29, 9:58 AM - Peter Blackhat: "Eh you'll be fine," he lied.

2016-09-29, 11:35 AM - Steph Curtis: Duuude sucks about food poisoning but teach me the ways to avoid colds. I'm always sick
2016-09-29, 11:37 AM - Peter Blackhat: Anything strong enough to overwhelm Jon's biology is the kind of thing that takes mortal peeps out for like a month, and leads men in lab coats to furrow their brows over results that make "No god damn sense!"
2016-09-29, 11:38 AM - Peter Blackhat: Coldfx works wonders though
2016-09-29, 11:39 AM - Peter Blackhat: I had bunches of stuff left over from the last time I was ill.
2016-09-29, 12:00 PM - Josh Power: The trick to not getting sick is to eat everything all the time and lick doorknobs to boost that immune system
2016-09-29, 12:00 PM - Josh Power: Works like a charm
2016-09-29, 12:02 PM - Jacob Myth: Mental fortitude. Dont even acknowledge the existence of the virus.
2016-09-29, 12:05 PM - Steph Curtis: Don't even acknowledge the existence of my physical body mass and cease to be a mortal being. Become a sentient orb of light
2016-09-29, 12:12 PM - Jacob Myth: Ya. Or I guess be more ghost like.
2016-09-29, 12:19 PM - Steph Curtis: Ghost lyfe

2016-09-29, 1:07 PM - John Rustle: Woah! That was pretty crazy
2016-09-29, 1:07 PM - Peter Blackhat: Definitely not us spamming pictures of you and then getting sad realizing it felt like your funeral slideshow.
2016-09-29, 1:08 PM - Peter Blackhat: Because those are definitely actually going to be the pictures for it, you just know it.
2016-09-29, 1:13 PM - Cole Basaraba: You guys are all magnificent.
2016-09-29, 1:13 PM - John Rustle: You started it

2016-09-29, 3:18 PM - Cole Basaraba: Yessiree Bub

2016-09-29, 3:22 PM - Steph Curtis: Also not gonna be able to make my elf costume. :( not enough time to order the armor material and make it

2016-09-29, 4:16 PM - Peter Blackhat: I watched Young Frankenstein yesterday to help get my October vibes going.  Never not funny.
2016-09-29, 4:16 PM - Peter Blackhat: Why don't you try using like thin PVC pipe and a hairdryer to mold it and then do clay on top and paint it?
2016-09-29, 4:28 PM - John Rustle: Or like paper mache it?
2016-09-29, 4:32 PM - Peter Blackhat: Quick question relevant to my work.  What do you guys smoke?
2016-09-29, 4:32 PM - John Rustle: Blackstone ports, long. And Belmont kings
2016-09-29, 4:36 PM - Josh Power: Belmont ki fs
2016-09-29, 4:36 PM - Josh Power: Kings
2016-09-29, 4:39 PM - Peter Blackhat: Thought so.
2016-09-29, 4:42 PM - Peter Blackhat: And for expedience I'll say Steph smokes the same things.
2016-09-29, 4:42 PM - John Rustle: Sure does
2016-09-29, 4:46 PM - Peter Blackhat: Beautiful, this may result in me taking you three out to dinner to reward your terrible habit.
2016-09-29, 4:46 PM - John Rustle: Ew why
2016-09-29, 4:50 PM - Peter Blackhat: Because our tobacco reps are terrible shitty people who constantly offer incentives for stupid bits of useless data that no one ever does.
2016-09-29, 4:50 PM - John Rustle: Wow that's crazy
2016-09-29, 4:51 PM - Peter Blackhat: It's okay, I also give them the lowest possible review scores every four months without fail.
2016-09-29, 4:52 PM - John Rustle: Hahaha jeez
2016-09-29, 5:03 PM - Josh Power: Dude, nice! Finally a benefit other than being cool as fuck

2016-10-02, 7:31 PM - John Rustle: Ah
2016-10-02, 7:40 PM - Josh Power: Wait, it's a burger? No autocorrect, just cinnamon and cranberry conjure up that flavour in my mind

2016-10-02, 9:25 PM - Peter Blackhat: I could ask around if you like, I'm sure I might know someone trying to get rid of some to make space.
2016-10-02, 9:26 PM - Steph Curtis: YESSSS
2016-10-02, 9:27 PM - Steph Curtis: I'm going to try to convince Katie and Jake to say yes to a higher table though so we could get stools

2016-10-03, 8:13 PM - Peter Blackhat: Mostly, but I'd rather spend $15 on ColdFX than drink an energy drink.
2016-10-03, 8:14 PM - John Rustle: Would you
2016-10-03, 8:14 PM - John Rustle: I'm sure you have a 2 for 4 special

2016-10-04, 5:50 PM - Peter Blackhat: Happy First Week after moving out.
2016-10-04, 5:50 PM - Peter Blackhat: So I talked to Jacob, and I feel like the kitchen table I found you is too big for the space.
2016-10-04, 5:50 PM - Peter Blackhat: Also someone already jacked up the barstools.
2016-10-04, 6:19 PM - Peter Blackhat: Random: Just realized my favourite Macy Gray song was a collaboration with Fatboy Slim.  They had it on separate albums without accrediting each other in the title.  Bless you, Spotify.
2016-10-04, 6:50 PM - John Rustle: @12505080563 do Dominos drivers shit talk me for ordering $11.99 pizzas delivered?
2016-10-04, 6:50 PM - John Rustle: I always feel so bad lol
2016-10-04, 6:51 PM - Peter Blackhat: She hasn't worked for then in like... five months lol
2016-10-04, 6:51 PM - John Rustle: Yeah I know I just mean in general
2016-10-04, 6:51 PM - Peter Blackhat: Probably.
2016-10-04, 6:51 PM - John Rustle: Like when you come back from a delivery are you like "that asshole made me drive all the way there for $10 worth of pizza fuck"
2016-10-04, 6:52 PM - Peter Blackhat: But it's to pass the time, nothing personal.
2016-10-04, 6:52 PM - Josh Power: How's your tip?
2016-10-04, 6:52 PM - John Rustle: just the tip? ;)
2016-10-04, 6:53 PM - John Rustle: 10.99+3.99 delivery brings it to $15. I usually tip about 2.50-3$ on the order
2016-10-04, 6:53 PM - Nicole Gibson: Yes they do
2016-10-04, 6:54 PM - John Rustle: K cool
2016-10-04, 6:54 PM - Josh Power: Yeah totally fair. I imagine they do shit talk, but that'd be shitty. I mean, every pizza you order keeps them in a job
2016-10-04, 6:54 PM - Josh Power: Fuck em
2016-10-04, 6:54 PM - John Rustle: I mean like there are crack whores giving blow jobs for like $5
2016-10-04, 6:54 PM - John Rustle: I'm giving $3 for you to get to my driveway lol
2016-10-04, 6:55 PM - Nicole Gibson: Haha. Its just because most times you deliver cheap orders you get shitty tips cause the bill isnt big. But then again ive delivered $70 orders and got like $2.50 in a tip so its nothing personal, we're just greedy
2016-10-04, 6:56 PM - Nicole Gibson: And the minimum order for delivery is $15 so when it is like juuuuusstt enough it's just a pain in the ass to go that far and get like nothing from it
2016-10-04, 6:56 PM - Nicole Gibson: Delivery drivers are greedy mofos
2016-10-04, 6:56 PM - Nicole Gibson: U cool tho
2016-10-04, 8:41 PM - Jacob Myth: Fuck these stoopid early bus drivers that leave early. 20 mins gone like that.
2016-10-04, 8:45 PM - Josh Power: Man such a shitty thing. I don't understand how they can't actually keep to their schedule
2016-10-04, 8:51 PM - Steph Curtis: How is the commute though? Aside from poopy bus drivers?
2016-10-04, 9:02 PM - Jacob Myth: From the start point at uvic too... Ah well. Got a new dope happy prog metal band groovin while studying. Feeling like an A grade album.
2016-10-04, 9:03 PM - Jacob Myth: Uh i think i got on the wrong bus. Lol.
2016-10-04, 9:11 PM - Josh Power: No! No way man
2016-10-04, 9:15 PM - Peter Blackhat: Honestly walking the 20ish minutes across the bridge after taking the 50 farther down probably only loses you 10min top over jumping the 14.
2016-10-04, 9:15 PM - Peter Blackhat: Already figure anytime I visit that'll be my route.  Cardio is good for the soul etc, etc
2016-10-04, 9:25 PM - Jacob Myth: Im not sure. Usually i wont go back to uvic after work. But theres 2 buses that go by the place straight from uvic.
2016-10-04, 9:27 PM - Jacob Myth: I bused from uvic so you be wrong.
2016-10-04, 9:27 PM - John Rustle: Jacob I'm sorry you're having a bad time
2016-10-04, 9:29 PM - Jacob Myth: Lol. All good. Just venting. And i lost my earbud rubber thing piece thing. I think these things only happen on pre test days.

2016-10-04, 9:51 PM - Jacob Myth: Tomorrow night for sure dude.

2016-10-04, 9:52 PM - Peter Blackhat: Having to track down some for a few of these Korean ones that apparently have nothing lol
2016-10-04, 9:57 PM - Josh Power: Hmmmm. Tough to say. I'd probably go sub personally
2016-10-04, 9:57 PM - Peter Blackhat: Good man.
2016-10-04, 9:58 PM - Peter Blackhat: I'll have this shit loaded in the chamber when next there is spookiness to be had.

2016-10-06, 6:46 AM - Steph Curtis: Pelican stretches yo
2016-10-06, 6:46 AM - Steph Curtis: Also I just had a terrifying dream that I had a tiny baby. She was mad at me for having a commute to work

2016-10-06, 8:01 AM - Peter Blackhat: I had to close again >.< but I may Floyd to reward myself prior.
2016-10-06, 8:33 AM - Steph Curtis: Do you guys know of any stores with like.. weord assortments of things? Buckles, electronics buttons, keyboards, nuts and bolts and stuff?
2016-10-06, 8:33 AM - Steph Curtis: I can't think of the name of the type of store it is but it's like a hodgepodge of electronics and odds an ends
2016-10-06, 8:34 AM - Peter Blackhat: Stuff and things, gotcha.
2016-10-06, 8:37 AM - Peter Blackhat: Yeah, I got nothing.  I'd just go down to Alpine an go through their electronics recycling and break off whatever I needed for keyboards and buttons, find a cheap hardware store for the others, though no idea where you'd find bulk buckles.
2016-10-06, 8:41 AM - Josh Power: Value village, the place by Floyd's
2016-10-06, 8:42 AM - Peter Blackhat: That kitchen surplus store?
2016-10-06, 8:48 AM - Josh Power: Yeah man
2016-10-06, 8:48 AM - Josh Power: They have everything
2016-10-06, 9:11 AM - Peter Blackhat: Oh man I hope she's making robot pumpkins.
2016-10-06, 9:26 AM - Steph Curtis: Haha unfortunately not... :( I'm getting the worbla after all so I want to make my armour. But I need to get some straps and buckles and odds and ends to make it how I want
2016-10-06, 9:26 AM - Steph Curtis: Thanks for the tips dudes
2016-10-06, 9:26 AM - Peter Blackhat: Oh dope!

2016-10-06, 12:57 PM - Steph Curtis: I have no clue how I'll afford this
2016-10-06, 12:57 PM - Ashley!!: What happened!!! Do you have insurance?
2016-10-06, 1:05 PM - Steph Curtis: Entirely my fault. It was so stupid but another car came zooming in and I thought they'd hit me so I zoomed what I thought would be reverse but I was in drive to correct my direction and then scraped into the car in front of me. Dented and scraped along this ritzy expensive SUV
2016-10-06, 1:05 PM - Steph Curtis: I have insurance but this whole thing sucks
2016-10-06, 1:06 PM - Steph Curtis: Happened super fast and I feel so stupid
2016-10-06, 1:11 PM - Peter Blackhat: Well that's understandable, but you're not hurt and no one else is either, which is considerably more important.
2016-10-06, 1:12 PM - Peter Blackhat: Stress about the money tomorrow, you still have to survive today.
2016-10-06, 1:13 PM - Steph Curtis: Have to call my insurance. Can't wait until tomorrow. Sorry for being a downer guys. I'm just in a pretty low spot right now
2016-10-06, 1:15 PM - Peter Blackhat: You have nothing to apologize to us for, Steph.  The point of having friends is so when this happens, you can tell us, and we can do our best to reach through whatever distance separates us to out a hand to your shoulder and tell you that you're not alone, nor will you ever be, and it's going to be okay.
2016-10-06, 1:24 PM - John Rustle: It happens man, your insurance will totally take care of it too! Seems to be the season for a lil bit I'm bad luck
2016-10-06, 1:24 PM - John Rustle: O'*

2016-10-17, 3:58 PM - Peter Blackhat: I didn't care to look.
2016-10-17, 4:01 PM - Cole Basaraba: Well if I don't end up finding it, Someone has a Loooot of explaining to do.
2016-10-17, 4:12 PM - Jacob Myth: Cole basaraba in the search for the red charger.

2016-10-17, 4:31 PM - Jacob Myth: "Yo chief basa-bam. You realize this isnt just about the red charger anymore. This all links back to the summer deaths of '09."
2016-10-17, 4:50 PM - Cole Basaraba: The Dexfield massacre. ..how could I forget.
2016-10-17, 5:04 PM - Jacob Myth: How could you forget when your partner Redbeck was the primary suspect. Of course we havent seen him in years. Unbelievable that he took off in a red charger similar to the ones found in the pockets of some of the victims. Think it was coincidence chief? You still trust redbeck, right?
2016-10-17, 5:05 PM - Peter Blackhat: Guys there was a toy car in the toilet
2016-10-17, 5:05 PM - Peter Blackhat: Relax

2016-10-17, 5:07 PM - Peter Blackhat: It's kind of my thing.
2016-10-17, 5:08 PM - Jacob Myth: Why do you think he took off chief? Did he say anything to you that night?
2016-10-17, 5:08 PM - Cole Basaraba: It is your thing, it is....Has been since the Dexfield massacre of 09 it would seem.
2016-10-17, 5:10 PM - Cole Basaraba: Not a word, He didn't even say goodbye to Rebecca. Way things were looking, I can't say that I blame him. Those folks wanted to see him hanged something awful.
2016-10-17, 5:24 PM - John Rustle: Making apple crumble tonight if anyone wants some
2016-10-17, 5:36 PM - Jacob Myth: I guess the law can only reach so far. Also, Chief. Weren't Rebecca and Redbeck seen going for apple crumble and coffee most Monday evenings?

2016-10-19, 11:47 PM - Peter Blackhat: The campaign is cool so far, and I dig that every 5 HP you lose you draw a card, so if you get fucked up you make up card advantage at least.

2016-10-23, 9:11 PM - Peter Blackhat: 'Do It' by them is one of those songs that never fails to get me swaying in my chair, for sure.

2016-10-25, 12:19 PM - Peter Blackhat: Hahaha STEPH!!  Why would you assume that?!
2016-10-25, 12:20 PM - Steph Curtis: It was a bunch of small things that started to worry  me haha. And you know me -- I piece little things together until they add up to one awful big thing so I was scared when marv called me into his office

2016-10-25, 12:24 PM - Peter Blackhat: <Media omitted>

2016-10-25, 3:08 PM - Steph Curtis: Dude Josh your pumpkin is blowing me away
2016-10-25, 3:11 PM - Peter Blackhat: Jacob, I think I fixed my deck.  I also realized I have three of those guys that draw you two cards if you have more HP.
2016-10-25, 3:11 PM - Peter Blackhat: After I finish the horrible crap after work we have to play test it again.
2016-10-25, 3:32 PM - Jacob Myth: Sure. I can be your deck buddy.
2016-10-25, 3:33 PM - Jacob Myth: Probably want heal or aggro studd for that draw two card guy.
2016-10-25, 3:34 PM - Peter Blackhat: Yarp, I switched some stuff to ramp up to my big guys much quicker.  Put in Goldbrand too because you were super right.
2016-10-25, 3:35 PM - Josh Power: Damn, thanks dude! I was pretty frustrated with it at first
2016-10-25, 3:35 PM - Jacob Myth: Goldbrand is like a control value card.
2016-10-25, 3:36 PM - Peter Blackhat: I put it out on turn four once and retook a really terrible situation, so it won my favour.
2016-10-25, 3:38 PM - Jacob Myth: You playing more ramp now?
2016-10-25, 3:39 PM - Peter Blackhat: Just a splash for my 6 and 5 drop guys who only really do anything when they are already in play.

2016-11-14, 9:14 AM - Peter Blackhat: You know guys, there's good news, and then there's good news about your reproductive system.
2016-11-14, 9:16 AM - John Rustle: What
2016-11-14, 9:23 AM - Peter Blackhat: I got some of the latter.  You really want the details? lol
2016-11-14, 9:23 AM - Ashley!!: Yes
2016-11-14, 9:23 AM - Steph Curtis: Were your reproductive systems at risk? I'm glad you got good news!
2016-11-14, 9:27 AM - Peter Blackhat: First off is everyone not eating food or enjoying a beverage?
2016-11-14, 9:28 AM - Peter Blackhat: Because there was totes blood in my semen for like two weeks a while ago.
2016-11-14, 9:28 AM - Peter Blackhat: Like a LOT
2016-11-14, 9:48 AM - Josh Power: Oh man. That would be TERRIFYING
2016-11-14, 9:48 AM - Josh Power: So glad you're okay
2016-11-14, 9:52 AM - Peter Blackhat: Heh yeah it was, and it was also awkward because I was not the one who noticed.
2016-11-14, 9:53 AM - Peter Blackhat: Luckily it's generally benign and goes away on it's own, but I wasn't taking no chances so I had a bunch of tests done to see if I'd need my prostate biopsy'd.
2016-11-14, 9:55 AM - Peter Blackhat: Though you'll all be disappointed to know I was not rendered sterile from the event.
2016-11-14, 10:09 AM - Josh Power: Damn dude, Petey gettin' laid!
2016-11-14, 10:22 AM - Jacob Myth: The ringing sound of many tiny pete-lings.
2016-11-14, 10:23 AM - Ashley!!: Also must have been terrifying for the other party involved just saying
2016-11-14, 10:23 AM - Jacob Myth: Glad that your junk is still in working order Pete. Would've been scary.
2016-11-14, 10:36 AM - Peter Blackhat: Yup, now that I know I'm fine I can stop being terrified and make jokes, which is nice.
2016-11-14, 10:37 AM - Peter Blackhat: Heh it was like a while ago but yeah, she was confused and then, to her credit, very concerned for my heart rate.
2016-11-14, 10:37 AM - Peter Blackhat: And thank you for your kind words about my penis and penis accessories.
2016-11-14, 10:38 AM - Julian Stacey!: So, surprise bloody semen is just a thing that happens to people? For no apparent reason?
2016-11-14, 10:39 AM - John Rustle: Man Pete, I had that happen to me once.
2016-11-14, 10:39 AM - John Rustle: It was scary as f
2016-11-14, 10:39 AM - Julian Stacey!: There's some things they just don't prepare you for
2016-11-14, 10:39 AM - Julian Stacey!: Bloody ejaculations is one of them
2016-11-14, 10:39 AM - Josh Power: All I can think of is Antichrist
2016-11-14, 10:51 AM - Peter Blackhat: It's just sign if an infection generally, and luckily it was the one time Google was like "RELAX YOU'RE FINE"
2016-11-14, 10:52 AM - Peter Blackhat: But yeah, waiting for results of stuff for over a month was taxing and I am happy to be over with it.
2016-11-14, 10:52 AM - John Rustle: Yeah I totally googled it. And it was like "chill out. Panic if it happens a bunch"
2016-11-14, 10:52 AM - John Rustle: It is very hard to chill out
2016-11-14, 10:53 AM - John Rustle: Glad you're all good though dude
2016-11-14, 11:14 AM - Peter Blackhat: Thank you, I look forward to making eye contact with you all in the future.

2016-11-16, 2:59 PM - Steph Curtis: Like what HAPPENED to them
2016-11-16, 3:02 PM - Jacob Myth: Granny gravy. Best gravy.
2016-11-16, 3:13 PM - Steph Curtis: Hahaha.... Gross.
2016-11-16, 4:17 PM - Peter Blackhat: Oh wow this was something.
2016-11-16, 4:35 PM - Julian Stacey!: I don't know how I feel about gravy anymore
2016-11-16, 4:39 PM - John Rustle: I get the pleasure of talking to these fine folks all the time
2016-11-16, 4:42 PM - Josh Power: All I hear is "that's a lot of gravy, baby" ringing around in my head
2016-11-16, 4:43 PM - Cole Basaraba: I don't go more than a month without a good "Lots of gravy baby" echoing through my head
2016-11-16, 4:43 PM - Cole Basaraba: And now this
2016-11-16, 4:51 PM - Josh Power: That's a good point.
2016-11-16, 4:52 PM - Peter Blackhat: I have no idea what that is in reference to and now I do not wish to know.
2016-11-16, 4:59 PM - Josh Power: Well it doesn't matter anymore, it's become forever tainted
2016-11-16, 5:05 PM - John Rustle: Tainted gravy

2016-11-16, 7:18 PM - Peter Blackhat: Cole was like "Oh fuck man, that guys car looks like a shitty tribal tattoo," and then Jonah waved out of it and we lost it.
2016-11-16, 7:21 PM - Josh Power: No way!
2016-11-16, 7:23 PM - Peter Blackhat: Oh and we saw Jesse at Wal-dizzle but I wasn't sure how his gf handles being scared so I creeped up behind them a tosses a small bag of sun-dried tomatoes into their basket to get their attention.
2016-11-16, 7:23 PM - Peter Blackhat: Cole said I wasn't allowed to just yell across the store.
2016-11-16, 7:32 PM - Josh Power: Good job Cole

2016-11-18, 10:32 AM - Peter Blackhat: Haha
2016-11-18, 10:32 AM - Peter Blackhat: Fair
2016-11-18, 12:28 PM - Cole Basaraba: <Media omitted>
2016-11-18, 12:29 PM - Peter Blackhat: Firstly, I meant in an environment around it, not necessarily on the work itself.  Secondly, that is the maybe the worst one yet.
2016-11-18, 12:29 PM - Jacob Myth: üíì
2016-11-18, 12:31 PM - Cole Basaraba: Sooooo, more blue?

2016-11-18, 12:37 PM - Peter Blackhat: When I'm dead, these are going to cause some confusion with my other friends and family.
2016-11-18, 12:37 PM - Ashley!!: *she says with an accent*
2016-11-18, 12:42 PM - Peter Blackhat: If I die oddly, which I probably will, these pieces may lead to you being the prime suspect in my murder, Cole.
2016-11-18, 12:44 PM - Cole Basaraba: ....A...A book for all ages
2016-11-18, 12:46 PM - Ashley!!: 13 and under
2016-11-18, 12:47 PM - Peter Blackhat: That is not all ages.
2016-11-18, 12:47 PM - Cole Basaraba: Preferably 13 and under?
2016-11-18, 1:04 PM - Ashley!!: And grannies
2016-11-18, 6:01 PM - Peter Blackhat: Oh man, today went fucking sideways.
2016-11-18, 6:01 PM - John Rustle: Do tell
2016-11-18, 6:01 PM - John Rustle: Or don't
2016-11-18, 6:01 PM - John Rustle: Or whatever
2016-11-18, 6:02 PM - Peter Blackhat: I was off work two hours ago and I'm just leaving now because some kid swiped a wallet from one of my employees.
2016-11-18, 6:03 PM - Peter Blackhat: So I had to pull camera footage and fill out incident reports for three hours.
2016-11-18, 6:03 PM - John Rustle: Oh shit. Police report filed, and security cam checking?
2016-11-18, 6:03 PM - Peter Blackhat: But the RCMP guy was great, so there's that.
2016-11-18, 6:04 PM - Peter Blackhat: Helped her cancel her credit cards and talked her through replacing the rest of it.
2016-11-18, 6:04 PM - Peter Blackhat: Redialed the number he dialed when he used our phone and got his name and address.
2016-11-18, 6:06 PM - Josh Power: Detective Pete
2016-11-18, 6:06 PM - Josh Power: Keepin' the streets sweet
2016-11-18, 6:06 PM - Peter Blackhat: And we realized he left with a woman with a co-op number so I got her work and cell and address from our database too.
2016-11-18, 6:06 PM - Peter Blackhat: Which apparently saved the guy a lot of grief, so provably why he was so chill and helpful.
2016-11-18, 6:07 PM - Peter Blackhat: It was just exhausting, and now Alex has to do all my invoices and stuff from today.  I left him a sticky note with +50 XP on it.
2016-11-18, 6:10 PM - Peter Blackhat: So if you ever see a shitty looking teenager with a bright red backpack and shoes, a purple snapback, riding a blue Hoverboard (however will they find him).  Knock him over and smash it for making one of my favourite coworkers break down in a weepy mess.
2016-11-18, 6:10 PM - Josh Power: Hahaha noice
2016-11-18, 6:21 PM - Cole Basaraba: What a penis
2016-11-18, 6:28 PM - Peter Blackhat: Also, no pressure or obligation, but I promised Emily and Kolby I'd toss their GoFundMe for their dogs surgery out into the world.

2016-11-20, 9:47 AM - Peter Blackhat: I had a dream you guys were convinced the world was going to end on New Years Eve so you made me write all of your biographies to send into space.  When I asked how you all knew for sure, Josh showed me a picture on his phone of Jon building a HUGE FUCKING LAZER in his backyard with he caption "Drilling to China for New Years brb"
2016-11-20, 9:47 AM - John Rustle: Hahahahahahah that's beautiful
2016-11-20, 9:48 AM - Ashley!!: Best dream
2016-11-20, 9:48 AM - Peter Blackhat: You were there too and just went, "Yeah it's gonna be SIIIICK!  Wanna come?"
2016-11-20, 9:58 AM - Peter Blackhat: Really, I should have known to explain to dream Jon that Chinese New Years is at a different time.
2016-11-20, 11:39 AM - Julian Stacey!: I tried to find "death lazer" in my dream dictionary
2016-11-20, 11:39 AM - Julian Stacey!: No luck
2016-11-20, 11:43 AM - Peter Blackhat: Dreaming like a 'normal' person again has been weird.  I don't expect help from the dream dictionary.
2016-11-20, 11:55 AM - John Rustle: Anybody down for dog walks?
2016-11-20, 12:13 PM - Peter Blackhat: When ya thinking?

2016-11-20, 1:35 PM - Josh Power: That sounds amzing
2016-11-20, 2:45 PM - Peter Blackhat: Yeah, and if it wasn't $70 and so close to Christmas, I'd have bought it for myself already lol
2016-11-20, 3:24 PM - Peter Blackhat: It has like... 30 character archetypes just ready to go.  THERE'S A HEALER SUBTYPE CALLED 'QUACK AND TOOTH PULLER'
2016-11-20, 3:24 PM - Josh Power: Whuuuut
2016-11-20, 3:25 PM - Peter Blackhat: It's all very low fantasy rustic grims fairy tales kind thing.
2016-11-20, 8:32 PM - Julian Stacey!: That sounds all kinds of great
2016-11-20, 8:33 PM - Peter Blackhat: *sigh*
2016-11-20, 8:33 PM - Peter Blackhat: Yeah.
2016-11-20, 8:34 PM - Peter Blackhat: Bringing it to North America was a kickstarter I forgot about, so it's my own fault for not already having it.
2016-11-20, 9:20 PM - Peter Blackhat: Christ finding soundtracks for some games is a pain.
2016-11-20, 10:29 PM - Jacob Myth: Which?
2016-11-20, 10:45 PM - Peter Blackhat: Darkest Dungeon, Pillars of Eternity, and Banner Saga
2016-11-21, 12:17 PM - Steph Curtis: So my lunch today was an orange. But I'm gonna admit to you guys right now that the orange tastes like the smell of grass and plant bulbs
2016-11-21, 12:17 PM - Steph Curtis: It was really friggin weird.
2016-11-21, 12:40 PM - Peter Blackhat: We're you having a stroke?
2016-11-21, 12:58 PM - Steph Curtis: Ghosts don't have strokes silly!
2016-11-21, 1:04 PM - Peter Blackhat: There are plenty of reports of people being stroked by Ghosts!
2016-11-21, 1:14 PM - Steph Curtis: Dear god Pete
2016-11-21, 1:22 PM - Peter Blackhat: Well I didn't mean it in the sexual way but that too.
2016-11-21, 1:22 PM - Peter Blackhat: The ol' ghost grip.
2016-11-21, 1:43 PM - Steph Curtis: Hahahahaha that probably wouldn't be comfortable for anyone involved
2016-11-21, 2:21 PM - Peter Blackhat: If someone can watch 2525 hours of Grandma porn, then someone can get off to a spectral handjob.
2016-11-21, 2:24 PM - John Rustle: Yep
2016-11-21, 2:24 PM - Steph Curtis: There's a niche porn for everyone I guess
2016-11-21, 2:33 PM - Ashley!!: I'm into food porn
2016-11-21, 2:35 PM - Steph Curtis: See I'd be careful there. While I like pictures of sexy food as much as the next person, I feel like I would be incredibly uncomfortable with images of food being shoved in peoples body holes
2016-11-21, 2:42 PM - Peter Blackhat: What about that Japanese thing where they eat food off of naked women?  That count?  No idea what it's called.
2016-11-21, 2:43 PM - Ashley!!: Like maybe attractive people eating food sexually in a comedic way
2016-11-21, 2:43 PM - Ashley!!: Also Pete that's probably food porn too ???
2016-11-21, 2:44 PM - Steph Curtis: Okay yeah those are definitely better options than the horror show I was imagining
2016-11-21, 2:45 PM - Steph Curtis: "BUT THINK OF THE INFECTIONS - OH GOD"
2016-11-21, 2:45 PM - Ashley!!: There is mayonnaise where there definitely should not be mayonnaise
2016-11-21, 2:51 PM - Steph Curtis: I'm dying
2016-11-21, 2:52 PM - Peter Blackhat: Hahahahahaha
2016-11-21, 3:08 PM - Peter Blackhat: And I meant that there is probably some actual Japanese word for that.
2016-11-21, 3:08 PM - Peter Blackhat: *Cough* Jacob
2016-11-21, 3:16 PM - Josh Power: It's called "sushi", pete
2016-11-21, 3:20 PM - Peter Blackhat: There was a distinct lack of a naked woman acting as our plate the last time we got "sushi" then
2016-11-21, 3:29 PM - Ashley!!: I'm outraged!
2016-11-21, 3:29 PM - Steph Curtis: Soy sauce belly button
2016-11-21, 3:30 PM - Ashley!!: Ponzu 4evr
2016-11-21, 3:33 PM - Peter Blackhat: Or maybe she was just such a shy little wall flower that we didn't notice.
2016-11-21, 3:34 PM - Peter Blackhat: We'll have to go again to make surem
2016-11-21, 5:27 PM - Cole Basaraba: Somebody need to know a porn fact? I'll be doing an AMA on reddit later
2016-11-21, 5:28 PM - John Rustle: Man, Im literally reading an ask Reddit thread about NSFW facts
2016-11-21, 5:28 PM - Cole Basaraba: Nyotaimori Pete, And thats super weird
2016-11-21, 5:28 PM - Cole Basaraba: Anything good
2016-11-21, 5:28 PM - Peter Blackhat: Hahahaha I KNEW IT HAD A NAME
2016-11-21, 5:29 PM - Ashley!!: HAHAHAHAHA
2016-11-21, 5:29 PM - Ashley!!: What's the porn fact
2016-11-21, 5:29 PM - John Rustle: Supposedly if you have cancer, and are getting chemotherapy you can't have sex with your partner because your radioactive sperm will give her cancer
2016-11-21, 5:29 PM - John Rustle: It's basically poison
2016-11-21, 5:29 PM - Cole Basaraba: Brutal
2016-11-21, 5:29 PM - Ashley!!: Do you have something to tell me
2016-11-21, 5:29 PM - John Rustle: Which is also how Mary Jane died in a spiderman comic one time
2016-11-21, 5:29 PM - Ashley!!: Please don't ever get cancer
2016-11-21, 5:29 PM - John Rustle: Hahahaha
2016-11-21, 5:29 PM - Ashley!!: Wtf really
2016-11-21, 5:30 PM - John Rustle: If you scaled sperm up to the size of a human, during ejaculation it would be like a human being launched through a 16 mile long tunnel in 2 seconds.
2016-11-21, 5:30 PM - Ashley!!: That's disgustingly interesting
2016-11-21, 5:30 PM - Cole Basaraba: Wouldn't matter if he did on account of you two doing nothing aside from wholesome christian activities in your alone time
2016-11-21, 5:30 PM - Peter Blackhat: Also have any of you guys ever gone to the SFW Porn site?  They just MS Paint over gigs and JPEGs and it's hilarious.
2016-11-21, 5:30 PM - Peter Blackhat: Also I think I have that Spiderman Comic
2016-11-21, 5:31 PM - John Rustle: Brazil nuts are sexually transmissible.

I.e. if the man eats some, and his partner is allergic to them, his ejaculate may cause an allergic reaction.
2016-11-21, 5:31 PM - Cole Basaraba: Nnnnuts
2016-11-21, 5:31 PM - Ashley!!: Wow that's crazy!!
2016-11-21, 5:32 PM - Ashley!!: Also I'm a nun and took a vow.
2016-11-21, 5:32 PM - Peter Blackhat: I remember in a book once having the math breakdown of how many bits of data are transfered during ejaculation.  It was a lot.
2016-11-21, 5:32 PM - Ashley!!: Men are so strange.
2016-11-21, 5:34 PM - Peter Blackhat: Oh wow, make it a gender thing.
2016-11-21, 5:34 PM - Ashley!!: R u triggered
2016-11-21, 5:34 PM - John Rustle: Yeah i have that sperm data fact written down somewhere
2016-11-21, 5:35 PM - Ashley!!: Omfg
2016-11-21, 5:35 PM - Peter Blackhat: Aren't I always?
2016-11-21, 5:36 PM - John Rustle: 1500TB's of data in a single load
2016-11-21, 5:36 PM - John Rustle: Bam found it
2016-11-21, 5:38 PM - Ashley!!: I have an all new respect for birth control
2016-11-21, 5:40 PM - Peter Blackhat: As should we all.
2016-11-21, 5:42 PM - John Rustle: World's most intense firewall
2016-11-21, 5:43 PM - Peter Blackhat: Here here
2016-11-21, 5:46 PM - Jacob Myth: Wow, thats like USB 7.0.
2016-11-21, 5:47 PM - Jacob Myth: Good thing there's no data cap on sperm.
2016-11-21, 5:47 PM - John Rustle: Yeah, you'd think after 7 editions of USB they'd fix that issue with not being able to get it into the hole
2016-11-21, 5:50 PM - Peter Blackhat: Hahaha
2016-11-21, 5:51 PM - John Rustle: Thanks for the sympathy laugh
2016-11-21, 5:53 PM - Peter Blackhat: No sympathy, only legitimate chuckles earned through hard work.
2016-11-22, 12:04 PM - Steph Curtis: <Media omitted>
2016-11-22, 12:04 PM - Steph Curtis: Guys read the top one. Like how are property managers missing this stuff?
2016-11-22, 12:04 PM - Steph Curtis: Its gibberish!
2016-11-22, 12:06 PM - Steph Curtis: And the second one "perform all of the respect to that pet..." I swear they don't even read these when they're throwing things together
2016-11-22, 12:11 PM - Peter Blackhat: Hahahaha legalese from people who have no idea how to write legalese.
2016-11-22, 12:11 PM - Peter Blackhat: I bet they feel professional as fuck writing that shit down though.  Power suits dialed to 11.
2016-11-22, 12:20 PM - Steph Curtis: It wasn't even him who drafted it! You are required to get a lawyer to draft these but he was copying it over in a notice and somehow just missed all of it
2016-11-22, 12:21 PM - Peter Blackhat: Fuckin' interns man.
2016-11-22, 12:21 PM - Steph Curtis: How did they think this made any sense?! I had to rewrite all their bylaws as per the lawyer's draft because it was so poorly done
2016-11-22, 12:21 PM - Steph Curtis: Buhhhhh
2016-11-22, 12:23 PM - Peter Blackhat: Invoice them for it!
2016-11-22, 12:24 PM - Steph Curtis: That'd just be my paycheck haha
2016-11-22, 12:25 PM - John Rustle: Wuuuuut
2016-11-22, 2:52 PM - Peter Blackhat: No way, extra consultation fee.
2016-11-22, 3:43 PM - Steph Curtis: Today has been such a ridiculous day and I will tell you once again that realtors are the satan-foot-fungi of the world
2016-11-22, 3:46 PM - Peter Blackhat: I'll have you know my favourite Hamster growing up had an imaginary job as a Realtor.
2016-11-22, 3:52 PM - Steph Curtis: Imaginary.
2016-11-22, 3:52 PM - Steph Curtis: Key word
2016-11-22, 3:52 PM - Peter Blackhat: Well yeah.  He couldn't read, Steph!  It was a pipe dream at best.
2016-11-22, 3:53 PM - Steph Curtis: Rel realtors are the worst
2016-11-22, 3:59 PM - Peter Blackhat: Ok fair.
2016-11-22, 4:00 PM - Ashley!!: Guys I get my huge sailor moon sternum piece on thursday
2016-11-22, 4:01 PM - Cole Basaraba: OooooohSiiiick! Do you have an image of the image?
2016-11-22, 4:03 PM - Peter Blackhat: RIIIIGHT!!  Fuck that's gonna be awesome.
2016-11-22, 4:04 PM - Peter Blackhat: And itchy.
2016-11-22, 4:04 PM - Peter Blackhat: I imaginem
2016-11-22, 4:04 PM - Ashley!!: And painful! I have no clue what it looks like yet LOL maybe I should message Caleb and ask him to send me a picture >.>
2016-11-22, 4:08 PM - Ashley!!: <Media omitted>
2016-11-22, 4:11 PM - Peter Blackhat: Suicide Girls, eat your heart out.
2016-11-22, 4:16 PM - Cole Basaraba: Radical
2016-11-22, 4:30 PM - Ashley!!: Hahahaha I've heard awful things about that company
2016-11-22, 4:42 PM - Peter Blackhat: Probably, but the Blackheart Burlesque was awesome and Josh wuvs his screensaver.
2016-11-22, 4:43 PM - Josh Power: Man, I don't know about "wuv". More like I set it to that 5 years ago and am unmotivated to change it
2016-11-22, 4:44 PM - Peter Blackhat: Bewbs
2016-11-22, 4:45 PM - John Rustle: Yeah I've also heard horrible things about the company too. Especially ownership of photos
2016-11-22, 4:48 PM - Peter Blackhat: Oh that's a dick move.  Why errbody gotta be sleazy?
2016-11-22, 4:50 PM - John Rustle: Because sex sells?
2016-11-22, 4:50 PM - John Rustle: Because mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell
2016-11-22, 4:50 PM - Peter Blackhat: Ain't got no sex to sell without the ladies, watermarks be damnedm
2016-11-22, 4:51 PM - Ashley!!: There's also this thing where it takes A LOT to be a suicide girl, you have to hire a photographer yourself, and there's a possibility that the company won't even take your photos. And if they do, it's very unlikely that you'll get on the front page/any publicity at all.
2016-11-22, 4:51 PM - Ashley!!: And they're mean af.
2016-11-22, 4:52 PM - Peter Blackhat: Booo!
2016-11-22, 4:59 PM - Peter Blackhat: I convinced four people to each take two hours of a shift on Friday so I wouldn't get robbed of the Puppet Jam.  *Bows*
2016-11-22, 6:00 PM - Peter Blackhat: https://youtu.be/vbMQfaG6lo8

2016-11-22, 9:29 PM - Peter Blackhat: I was sobbing, you're fucked.
2016-11-23, 12:57 AM - John Rustle: Pete. Neither of us cried
2016-11-23, 6:16 AM - Peter Blackhat: Well you are both monsters.

2016-11-23, 2:50 PM - John Rustle: <Media omitted>
2016-11-23, 2:57 PM - Peter Blackhat: <Media omitted>
2016-11-23, 3:00 PM - John Rustle: Ew take it back
2016-11-23, 3:00 PM - Peter Blackhat: I'll make you a flash drive, as a sign if support for your blatant appropriation of my image and likeness.
2016-11-23, 3:52 PM - Steph Curtis: Hey guys - please do me a huge favour and lost your absolute favourite cartoon
2016-11-23, 3:52 PM - Steph Curtis: @17785332994 should I assume sailor moon?
2016-11-23, 3:53 PM - Josh Power: *list?
2016-11-23, 3:53 PM - Steph Curtis: Yes!
2016-11-23, 3:53 PM - Steph Curtis: Sorry >.<
2016-11-23, 3:57 PM - Cole Basaraba: Oooooh, Big question. I think my brain just shut down.
2016-11-23, 4:03 PM - Cole Basaraba: Big fan of cartoons from the 1930s, Anything Ub Iwerks animated is absolute genius.
2016-11-23, 4:04 PM - Peter Blackhat: My ABSOLUTE favourite?
2016-11-23, 4:05 PM - Peter Blackhat: Oh man.
2016-11-23, 4:06 PM - Ashley!!: Hahaha sailor Moon for sure!
2016-11-23, 4:07 PM - John Rustle: UMMM.
2016-11-23, 4:07 PM - Jacob Myth: I haven't seen it.
2016-11-23, 4:07 PM - John Rustle: Probably aqua teen hunger force
2016-11-23, 4:07 PM - John Rustle: Or dragon ball
2016-11-23, 4:07 PM - Cole Basaraba: HeyAshleyWhosYourFavoriteSailorScout?
2016-11-23, 4:07 PM - John Rustle: I've spent about 1/3rd of my life watching both of those
2016-11-23, 4:08 PM - Jacob Myth: I'd have to agree with Jon. Cat soup and samurai jack are pre good too.
2016-11-23, 4:15 PM - Peter Blackhat: Jupiter!
2016-11-23, 4:15 PM - John Rustle: Oh damn cat soup
2016-11-23, 4:16 PM - Peter Blackhat: Yeah, Jacob, I was thinking Samurai Jack too.
2016-11-23, 4:16 PM - Cole Basaraba: <Media omitted>
2016-11-23, 4:16 PM - Peter Blackhat: Fucking duh it is.
2016-11-23, 4:20 PM - Peter Blackhat: Okay yeah, I am officially locking in Samurai Jack as my answer.  I wrote a bunch of names on a napkin and did a head to head.  Cowboy Bebop had a strong showing though.
2016-11-23, 4:21 PM - Peter Blackhat: It was painful to choose between that and Steven Universe in the semifinals honestly.
2016-11-23, 4:22 PM - Jacob Myth: Samurai champloo too. Hmm. If just 1 probably have to go dbz.
2016-11-23, 4:23 PM - Peter Blackhat: That soundtrack.
2016-11-23, 4:26 PM - Jacob Myth: Forgot about evangelion. Maybe that.
2016-11-23, 4:26 PM - Peter Blackhat: Stop it.  I made my choice to stop from agonizing over it all day!
2016-11-23, 4:26 PM - John Rustle: Man, evangelion was not that good in retrospect. There have been way better series
2016-11-23, 4:27 PM - Peter Blackhat: Fight fight fight!
2016-11-23, 4:28 PM - Jacob Myth: I have to rewatch. Been like 10yrs. Haha.
2016-11-23, 4:28 PM - Peter Blackhat: They consolidated then into movies didn't they?
2016-11-23, 4:29 PM - Jacob Myth: Theyve consolidated the first half of the show then completely changed the ending twice.
2016-11-23, 4:30 PM - John Rustle: Yeah... Didn't the main writer get like sever depression? And the ending / last movie was just complete garbage?
2016-11-23, 4:31 PM - Jacob Myth: I liked the ending lol. New movies aren't done yet. But pt 3 was strange.
2016-11-23, 4:32 PM - Jacob Myth: Is akira a cartoon?
2016-11-23, 4:39 PM - Ashley!!: @12504137355  sailor Moon but when she is queen serenity cause' she's much less of a meatball head and more wise/kind. Or chibi Moon üòç
2016-11-23, 4:41 PM - Ashley!!: ALSO SAILOR P BECAUSE SHE SACRIFICED HER LIFE FOR CHIBI MOON BC SHE KNEW SHE WAS THE SAME ON THE INSIDE AND JUST NEEDED A FRIEND EVEN THO SHE WAS BEING CONTROLLED BY THE DARK MOON AT THE TIME
2016-11-23, 4:43 PM - Peter Blackhat: Yeah... Ashley those are wrong answers.  It was Jupiter.
2016-11-23, 4:43 PM - Peter Blackhat: Also Jacob just remembered the Simpsons and is at a loss again.
2016-11-23, 4:45 PM - Josh Power: That is such a hard question Steph! I think I'm stuck between Aqua Teen Hunger Force and The Simpsons
2016-11-23, 4:45 PM - Cole Basaraba: Yes. Although Jupiter is the correct answer, I appreciate the in depth answer, You are a true fan and I respect that.
2016-11-23, 4:46 PM - Jacob Myth: Ghibli movies...
2016-11-23, 4:47 PM - Peter Blackhat: THOSE DON'T COUNT OR WE'LL BE HERE FOR WEEKS
2016-11-23, 4:48 PM - Ashley!!: You only like Jupiter cause she's gay
2016-11-23, 4:50 PM - Peter Blackhat: Is she?
2016-11-23, 4:50 PM - Peter Blackhat: Weren't there other gay ones I didn't pick, regardless?
2016-11-23, 4:51 PM - Ashley!!: Jupiter and uranus are a couple ....................
2016-11-23, 4:51 PM - Ashley!!: Nvm that's a lie
2016-11-23, 4:52 PM - Ashley!!: That's Neptune I'm thinking of FML
2016-11-23, 4:53 PM - Peter Blackhat: Well either way it has no bearing in my decision.
2016-11-23, 5:06 PM - Julian Stacey!: So are movies fair game in this decision, or are we just talking cartoon shows?
2016-11-23, 5:16 PM - Nicole Gibson: Probably recess
2016-11-23, 5:16 PM - Peter Blackhat: FUUUUCK

2016-11-24, 5:22 PM - Nicole Gibson: Why would you ever want to reduce butts....
2016-11-24, 5:22 PM - Peter Blackhat: ^
2016-11-24, 5:22 PM - John Rustle: Because they tag you in annoying things and only have one butt picture
2016-11-24, 5:22 PM - Josh Power: Cause the butts arr robots
2016-11-24, 5:22 PM - Josh Power: Robutts

2016-11-24, 6:16 PM - Steph Curtis: I'm hella stressed and need to get gifts under way
2016-11-24, 9:18 PM - Cole Basaraba: If we are down two people, We'll postpone. Could use the extra time in that case. I'll tell Ian
2016-11-24, 9:19 PM - Peter Blackhat: "____ and the ____lings" just doesn't have the same ring.

2016-12-02, 5:51 PM - Peter Blackhat: What about Ashley?  I'll just grab my own in the same row if we want to ensure Sailor Jam is in.

2016-12-02, 5:59 PM - Peter Blackhat: Because I'm not insane.
2016-12-02, 6:08 PM - Nicole Gibson: I was like, "alex b actually has a crew....?"

2016-12-02, 6:49 PM - John Rustle: That sounds just dandy
2016-12-02, 6:49 PM - Josh Power: Jake, "me and steph" totally would have worked there
2016-12-02, 6:50 PM - Josh Power: Rule of thumb: if you remove the other person, does the sentence make sense?
2016-12-02, 6:52 PM - Peter Blackhat: Yeah, depends on if you adhere to the overly elitist Blue Book grammatical principals via England.
2016-12-02, 6:52 PM - Peter Blackhat: Which I do as a stuffy condescending shit.
2016-12-02, 6:52 PM - Josh Power: I've not read that one!
2016-12-02, 6:52 PM - John Rustle: Pretty sure I had a teacher that would threaten to kill me if I didnt follow the Pete rules
2016-12-02, 6:53 PM - John Rustle: Also Cole did the same thing right before jacob
2016-12-02, 6:53 PM - John Rustle: But I chose to hassle Jacob about it for no good reason at all
2016-12-02, 6:53 PM - Peter Blackhat: @12504137355 Just let me know where you bought the seats.
2016-12-02, 6:55 PM - Josh Power: Oh man holy shit I got confused. I thought he was the one that said that. Like he was jaking us or something
2016-12-02, 6:56 PM - Peter Blackhat: Jacob is sick and finished his final he's probably lacking the energy to properly defend himself.  Ripe for mockery.
2016-12-02, 6:57 PM - Peter Blackhat: But yeah the Blue Book of grammar is as rigid and thoughtless as Elements of Style, so praised as gospel by traditionalists.
2016-12-02, 6:57 PM - Cole Basaraba: Row J Left side facing the screen. I think 19 to 26
2016-12-02, 6:58 PM - Peter Blackhat: Spunk and Bite is the real writing guide that should rest in every clever heart.
2016-12-02, 7:04 PM - Jacob Myth: What did I do?

2016-12-02, 8:57 PM - John Rustle: Like actually 1030. Loki's still on meds so someone would have to be home the whole time with him. Jess is gonna come pick me up and it would have to be before Ashley goes to work so he's not alone
2016-12-02, 8:58 PM - Peter Blackhat: Aight, cool.

2016-12-03, 9:52 AM - Cole Basaraba: Oh jesus

2016-12-04, 6:04 PM - Peter Blackhat: Hmm, I'm off at four.  Someone gonna be home if I swing by omw to the homestead?
2016-12-04, 6:08 PM - John Rustle: Tomorrow or today?
2016-12-04, 6:09 PM - Peter Blackhat: Tomorrow, it is already after four today, but I understand my phrasing was not super specific.
2016-12-04, 7:04 PM - Ashley!!: Hahaha neither of us will be there until after 7pm tomorrow
2016-12-04, 7:04 PM - John Rustle: I'm taking tomorrow off so loki isn't alone all day
2016-12-04, 7:04 PM - Peter Blackhat: Dawwww, you're such a good Dad.
2016-12-05, 11:48 AM - Josh Power: Hey folks, we should nail down a date for Friendsmas; Jan 1 is a Sunday, and though most of us will likely be hungover it will give us the next day to recuperate. Alternatively, Jan 2 should work as well as I imagine most places will be closed and most of us will have it off (not sure about Shaw/Costco/CoOp/Market)
2016-12-05, 11:48 AM - Josh Power: (/Canadian tire)
2016-12-05, 12:18 PM - Nicole Gibson: We're open until 6 on new years
2016-12-05, 12:18 PM - John Rustle: I'm free Jan 1st all day. Works the best for me
2016-12-05, 12:19 PM - Nicole Gibson: And i probably wont be here on new years, bridget and the gang, we're making a tradition of going to renfrew i think every new years
2016-12-05, 1:17 PM - Steph Curtis: Hey dudes. I won't be able to do friendsmas on the night of the 2nd but I'd be down with the 1st.
2016-12-05, 4:29 PM - Peter Blackhat: Didn't we do it on like the 12th last year?
2016-12-05, 4:31 PM - Josh Power: I think so. We could certainly push it further, but I figured new year's day would be optimal for time off
2016-12-05, 4:36 PM - Peter Blackhat: Well my schedule is extremely flexible, so it's not a big deal to me really
2016-12-05, 4:36 PM - John Rustle: I'm almost always off Saturday Sunday. Guaruntee off every sunday
2016-12-05, 4:45 PM - Steph Curtis: I'd hope for a Friday or Saturday as I work early Monday mornings
2016-12-05, 4:50 PM - Peter Blackhat: Ooo right we will all be very drunk
2016-12-05, 4:51 PM - John Rustle: I also work early Monday but eh fuck it
2016-12-05, 4:51 PM - Peter Blackhat: I refuse to break the tradition of obliterated on Ryan Shwepes by 4pm
2016-12-05, 4:52 PM - John Rustle: Who's this Ryan guy
2016-12-05, 4:52 PM - John Rustle: Are you cheating on me
2016-12-05, 4:52 PM - Peter Blackhat: JON THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO WOULD KILL IS ALL
2016-12-05, 4:52 PM - Steph Curtis: üëè
2016-12-05, 4:53 PM - Peter Blackhat: That was intentional.
2016-12-05, 5:13 PM - Josh Power: All reasons that Sunday the 1st is super ideal! Except frig I just remembered Nicole won't be there (boo-urns)
2016-12-05, 5:19 PM - Nicole Gibson: Well i will probably have to work anyways
2016-12-05, 5:19 PM - Nicole Gibson: So a sat would be ideal for me
2016-12-05, 5:19 PM - Nicole Gibson: Cause i won't be able to get any days off
2016-12-05, 5:20 PM - Nicole Gibson: Like i might might be able to... So if everyone else agrees on the 1st then I'll do my best
2016-12-05, 5:25 PM - Jacob Myth: Wait is this a morning afternoon or evening thang?
2016-12-05, 5:26 PM - John Rustle: All day?
2016-12-05, 5:27 PM - Steph Curtis: Hahaha all day with eggnog and draaanks and fraaaaands
2016-12-05, 5:28 PM - John Rustle: And team nap at 4pm
2016-12-05, 5:28 PM - Nicole Gibson: All day bruh
2016-12-05, 5:30 PM - Peter Blackhat: Yasd
2016-12-05, 5:36 PM - Josh Power: All dyay
2016-12-05, 5:39 PM - Jacob Myth: Sure
2016-12-05, 5:45 PM - Cole Basaraba: Provided everyone else can agree on a day, I will make it work on my end. Provided I have a few weeks notice
2016-12-05, 5:49 PM - Nicole Gibson: Yeah i just messaged the big man on campus so I'll see if i can get it off. Worse comes to worse I'm off at 6:30 then just have to catch up in the drunkness department to you guys
2016-12-05, 5:50 PM - Peter Blackhat: I should have woken up again by then
2016-12-05, 5:50 PM - Nicole Gibson: Poifect
2016-12-05, 7:46 PM - Peter Blackhat: I need votes.  Sun or Moon?
2016-12-05, 7:47 PM - John Rustle: More like bum or poon
2016-12-05, 7:49 PM - Peter Blackhat: I'm a Moon man generally, but Cole already got it and I feel like my Pokemon experience will be lessened if we're doing the exact same stuff.
2016-12-05, 7:50 PM - John Rustle: I feel like you've already made up your mind
2016-12-05, 7:55 PM - Josh Power: I'm going sun eventually pretty sure
2016-12-05, 7:57 PM - Peter Blackhat: Too true, Jon.
2016-12-05, 7:57 PM - Peter Blackhat: Deep down, I always knew.
2016-12-05, 8:04 PM - Ashley!!: We are open 8am-11pm but I can try to book it off! Friendsmas is much important
2016-12-05, 8:04 PM - Jacob Myth: What version did 12yr old peter want/buy?
2016-12-05, 8:08 PM - Peter Blackhat: Doesn't matter, I went with Sun.
2016-12-05, 8:08 PM - Jacob Myth: Sun = red =gold
2016-12-05, 8:09 PM - Peter Blackhat: My sister put me on the spot to grab something off Amazon and I agonized until I figured getting Pokemon this way would make buying a DS less daunting.
2016-12-05, 8:09 PM - Peter Blackhat: I'm a Blue, Silver man all day, but sometimes we gotta try something new.
2016-12-05, 8:11 PM - Jacob Myth: You done goofed.
2016-12-05, 8:11 PM - Peter Blackhat: Maybe, but I also feel like the pun game is better on Team Sun.
2016-12-05, 11:01 PM - Peter Blackhat: <Media omitted>
2016-12-05, 11:01 PM - John Rustle: I want to sleep
2016-12-05, 11:01 PM - Nicole Gibson: You're drunk go home
2016-12-05, 11:02 PM - Josh Power: Man I just got back from a dope snow walk
2016-12-05, 11:02 PM - Josh Power: So nice
2016-12-05, 11:02 PM - Josh Power: So...ice
2016-12-05, 11:03 PM - Peter Blackhat: I just got into bed and now I'm conflicted...
2016-12-06, 12:07 AM - Nicole Gibson: Oh so i just learned that if i have to work new years ill be off at 4, not 6. So i guess that's better
2016-12-06, 12:08 AM - John Rustle: Just in time for nap time
2016-12-06, 12:10 AM - Nicole Gibson: I'll need it üëå
2016-12-06, 1:16 PM - Steph Curtis: So guys one of our buildings had a unit that was forced to sell. No one had been allowed in it. Finally after the court order, the realtor was in the building... And opened up a closet... And found a secret door.
2016-12-06, 1:17 PM - Steph Curtis: This secret door was locked, it had bars like a prison cell but wood behind so you couldn't see in. It had a floor handle and a floor slot. It was scary as fuck
2016-12-06, 1:17 PM - Steph Curtis: No one can get in. It looks like a legit torture chamber door
2016-12-06, 1:18 PM - Steph Curtis: Everyone is still trying to figure out how to gain access. The man who the unit belonged to was a military guy who came into our office once to fight the lien and court ordered sale. He gave us all the creeps -- now this
2016-12-06, 1:43 PM - Josh Power: Holy shiiiiit
2016-12-06, 1:44 PM - John Rustle: Woah nuts
2016-12-06, 1:44 PM - John Rustle: I hope it's full of a secret stash of my little pony stuff. And the guy was a closet brony
2016-12-06, 1:46 PM - Josh Power: Best possible resolution
2016-12-06, 2:30 PM - Steph Curtis: Yeah. Its probably a BDSM torture chamber or some kid is stashed in there
2016-12-06, 2:31 PM - Jacob Myth: Isn't torture room rent like super cheap?
2016-12-06, 2:53 PM - Steph Curtis: Pretty sure you just pay in screams and sobs
2016-12-06, 3:59 PM - Steph Curtis: <Media omitted>
2016-12-06, 3:59 PM - Steph Curtis: Wtf guys
2016-12-06, 3:59 PM - Steph Curtis: We later found out that the walls in the original layout of the room had been moved specifically to create this chamber
2016-12-06, 4:02 PM - Ashley!!: There are no words
2016-12-06, 4:02 PM - Ashley!!: Break it the fuck down
2016-12-06, 4:04 PM - Peter Blackhat: OH DUDE DIDN'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT THAT GUY?!
2016-12-06, 4:13 PM - Jacob Myth: Wow. Fuck. Devil worship room \m/‚ï∞_‚ïØ\m/
2016-12-06, 4:15 PM - John Rustle: Worst glory hole ever
2016-12-06, 4:16 PM - Steph Curtis: I may have mentioned I was scared of an aggressive guy who I thought would bring a gun. Found out after hearing about the door that it was his suite
2016-12-06, 4:16 PM - Josh Power: Hmmmm
2016-12-06, 4:17 PM - Josh Power: Maybe it's a panic room? ....that locks from the outside
2016-12-06, 4:18 PM - Peter Blackhat: Freaky.
2016-12-06, 4:18 PM - Peter Blackhat: In other news, I sold my entire automotive quota for the week just in windshield washer fluid today.
2016-12-06, 4:23 PM - John Rustle: That's also freaky
2016-12-06, 4:25 PM - John Rustle: DUDE
2016-12-06, 4:25 PM - John Rustle: Could be a grow op
2016-12-06, 4:25 PM - John Rustle: In that room
2016-12-06, 4:25 PM - John Rustle: Doesn't make sense about the bars though...
2016-12-06, 4:26 PM - Josh Power: Unless he /wanted/ them to think it was a torture room
2016-12-06, 4:29 PM - Steph Curtis: Apparently there were bars added to the windows of the room this chamber branches off from. Seems super weird. Panic room is viable.. The guy was in the army so maybe he had PTSD and needed a safe place? Fuck I don't know
2016-12-06, 4:30 PM - Steph Curtis: Also congrats pete!
2016-12-06, 4:31 PM - Ashley!!: Guys. Michael dunahee.
2016-12-06, 4:32 PM - Ashley!!: Call the friggin police !!
2016-12-06, 4:35 PM - Peter Blackhat: Oh and thanks for the muffins, Ashley.
2016-12-06, 4:35 PM - Peter Blackhat: They will not survive tonight, but I'll save you one JP.
2016-12-06, 4:39 PM - Josh Power: Thanks man
2016-12-06, 4:39 PM - Josh Power: Whats tonight?
2016-12-06, 4:40 PM - Peter Blackhat: Me eating muffins.
2016-12-06, 4:42 PM - Josh Power: Oh lawl.
2016-12-06, 6:18 PM - Julian Stacey!: Woah. That closet
2016-12-06, 6:23 PM - Julian Stacey!: I feel like I have no right calling this person crazy or anything. I myself have always wanted a house with a panic chamber in the closet
2016-12-06, 6:25 PM - John Rustle: Can't tell if kidding or not
2016-12-06, 6:30 PM - Josh Power: Well, yeah, a panic room would be awesome. I don't know if I'd be in the market for lightless cell
2016-12-06, 6:31 PM - Peter Blackhat: I feel like I could take that door if I wanted you dead.
2016-12-06, 6:50 PM - Julian Stacey!: Oh yeah, not kidding
2016-12-06, 6:50 PM - Julian Stacey!: But not a creepy one
2016-12-06, 10:29 PM - Ashley!!: https://youtu.be/U9t-slLl30E

2016-12-07, 7:56 PM - John Rustle: Also woah that is the coolest painting
2016-12-07, 7:56 PM - Steph Curtis: Nah nothing.. I don't know if we will since the police are involved now. I really wanna know
2016-12-07, 7:57 PM - John Rustle: Ahhh fuck I was so invested
2016-12-07, 7:57 PM - Steph Curtis: Dude me, too. My whole office is on the edge of their seat
2016-12-07, 8:00 PM - Julian Stacey!: Hahaha, love that painting
2016-12-07, 8:07 PM - Josh Power: Hahahahahah

2016-12-09, 7:40 AM - Josh Power: It's beginning to look a lot like crispmas!
2016-12-09, 7:47 AM - Peter Blackhat: I'm going to make Rhys go around with and broom and ask people if they want their cars dusted off if he works today.
2016-12-09, 7:57 AM - Steph Curtis: Two guys on the street had to help me up my hill because I got stuck trying to drive to work
2016-12-09, 7:57 AM - Steph Curtis: Yuck
2016-12-09, 7:58 AM - Ashley!!: LOL @12505891790 don't give him hypothermia tho
2016-12-09, 7:58 AM - Ashley!!: I hate snow
2016-12-09, 8:02 AM - Peter Blackhat: I'll duct tape his gloves on and put newspaper in his jacket and shoes.  I got it covered.
2016-12-09, 8:03 AM - Peter Blackhat: Nicole does too, she's gonna be pissed when she wakes up.
2016-12-09, 8:03 AM - Peter Blackhat: Also should I hit Cole with a snowball when he gets out of the shower?
2016-12-09, 8:22 AM - Cole Basaraba: I vote no.
2016-12-09, 8:31 AM - Josh Power: I went outside and made a snowball, then when I got out of the shower threw it at myself to remind me what it's like to have roommates. What a lark!
2016-12-09, 8:32 AM - Peter Blackhat: That's beautiful and sad.
2016-12-09, 8:33 AM - Josh Power: I learned it by watching you
2016-12-09, 9:22 AM - Peter Blackhat: Checks out.
2016-12-09, 9:42 AM - Jacob Myth: How do you throw a snowball at yourself? Josh is actually secretly the flash?
2016-12-09, 9:50 AM - Josh Power: ‚ö°
2016-12-09, 9:51 AM - Josh Power: Man you know you're an adult when paying your bills makes you feel happy
2016-12-09, 9:52 AM - John Rustle: It's rewarding to be on top of them a bit, hey?
2016-12-09, 9:53 AM - Jacob Myth: Modern day happiness.
2016-12-09, 9:55 AM - Ashley!!: <Media omitted>

2016-12-12, 11:22 AM - Julian Stacey!: I was about to get started on buying gifts, but found out yesterday my credit card info got stolen
2016-12-12, 11:22 AM - Ashley!!: What!!!!!!
2016-12-12, 11:22 AM - Julian Stacey!: Then I get sent out of town for a couple weeks
2016-12-12, 11:22 AM - Peter Blackhat: Oh... good...
2016-12-12, 11:22 AM - Peter Blackhat: That's SUUUUUCKS dude, I'm sorry.
2016-12-12, 11:23 AM - Julian Stacey!: It's the first time it's happened to me. I feel like a real adult now
2016-12-12, 11:23 AM - Julian Stacey!: Nothing more grown-up than chopping a credit card in half, lol
2016-12-12, 11:27 AM - John Rustle: Man, that super sucks dude. Are you getting reimbursed?
2016-12-12, 11:39 AM - Julian Stacey!: I think so. It's being investigated now while my account is closed, but I'm sure it won't be hard to prove I wasn't going around salons in Calgary
2016-12-12, 11:40 AM - John Rustle: Haha yeah they're usually pretty good about that sort of thing
2016-12-12, 11:41 AM - Peter Blackhat: Of course it was some Alberta biatch
2016-12-12, 11:41 AM - Julian Stacey!: What would cost over 650 at a salon?
2016-12-12, 11:42 AM - Peter Blackhat: Sex
2016-12-12, 11:42 AM - Peter Blackhat: Like weird sex
2016-12-12, 12:16 PM - John Rustle: Hair straightener, woman's haircut, hair dye, and a tip? Lol
2016-12-12, 12:17 PM - John Rustle: Girls hair is expensive
2016-12-12, 12:17 PM - Peter Blackhat: Right, Hair.  Always forget that's a thing.
2016-12-12, 12:28 PM - Josh Power: Daaaamn duuude, that blows. At least they caught it eh
2016-12-12, 12:29 PM - Steph Curtis: Sorry that happened during the holidays (or at all) Julian. Hopefully you get reimbursed sooner than later!
2016-12-12, 1:06 PM - Peter Blackhat: Daawwww the girls at Floyd's bought my lunch for me üòÜ
2016-12-12, 1:50 PM - Steph Curtis: Woah whaaat whyyy
2016-12-12, 1:52 PM - Peter Blackhat: Guess they're just fans of Pete.  Christmas spirit and all that.
2016-12-12, 1:52 PM - Steph Curtis: Aaawe that's so sweet
2016-12-12, 1:53 PM - Peter Blackhat: Yeah. Gotta make sure they get an extra special card from ol' Pete.
2016-12-12, 2:12 PM - Peter Blackhat: @12504137355 A tube has arrived for you.
2016-12-12, 2:46 PM - Cole Basaraba: Squee* I wonder what it could be!
2016-12-12, 2:46 PM - Cole Basaraba: Oh Fuck. MyCorreiaPrints!
2016-12-12, 3:33 PM - Peter Blackhat: Oh cool!  I hope so
2016-12-12, 4:06 PM - Peter Blackhat: Dang Mayfair get all constructed and junk.
2016-12-12, 4:08 PM - John Rustle: Guys traffic is horrible heading into langford from downtown. I haven't moved in 10 mins
2016-12-12, 4:10 PM - Peter Blackhat: Hope it clears up by the time I head back home, that sounds shitty plus I don't have my headphones.
2016-12-12, 4:10 PM - John Rustle: There was an accident I assume. Ambulance just came jizzing past
2016-12-12, 4:10 PM - Peter Blackhat: Gross.
2016-12-12, 5:14 PM - Jacob Myth: That explains why my going home bus was so lateish.
2016-12-12, 5:19 PM - Peter Blackhat: I'm going to be in this Chapters for a million years.
2016-12-13, 6:21 AM - Ashley!!: Chapters at Christmas is my favorite thing ever esp when the Starbucks people come around w tiny hot chocolate
2016-12-13, 6:33 AM - John Rustle: http://xkcd.com/1771/

2016-12-13, 7:35 PM - Josh Power: Thurs 15 Dec Westshore
2016-12-13, 7:36 PM - Jacob Myth: Time should we be there?
2016-12-13, 7:36 PM - Josh Power: Whoops, meant to add : 10:10
2016-12-14, 6:35 PM - Julian Stacey!: Guys, I'm out of town for work right now, staying at a house that our company rents for employees. And my bedroom couldn't possibly be any creepier
2016-12-14, 6:35 PM - Ashley!!: Send pics
2016-12-14, 6:35 PM - Josh Power: Duuude that sounds awesome(and completely horrifying)
2016-12-14, 6:36 PM - John Rustle: Into the major spooks
2016-12-14, 6:38 PM - Julian Stacey!: In the basement, clearly used to be a young kid's room. 
The doorknob has been removed from the inside of the door, so if it closes you're trapped inside. The lightswitch is behind where the door swings  (so you have to walk into the dark room and half close the door to turn lights on)
Aaand the window doesn't open to outside. It looks out into part of the house crawlspace
2016-12-14, 6:39 PM - John Rustle: Oh awesome. Inside windows
2016-12-14, 6:39 PM - Josh Power: Oh gooood
2016-12-14, 6:39 PM - Julian Stacey!: There's little kid drawings and names written on the inside of the closet
2016-12-14, 6:40 PM - Julian Stacey!: Weird stains everywhere
2016-12-14, 6:40 PM - Julian Stacey!: Actually I can't attest to the weirdness of the stains. They're just stains
2016-12-14, 6:41 PM - John Rustle: All stains are weird if you think about it
2016-12-14, 6:42 PM - Julian Stacey!: <Media omitted>
2016-12-14, 6:42 PM - Ashley!!: What the Frick
2016-12-14, 6:42 PM - John Rustle: At least they're double paned glass
2016-12-14, 6:43 PM - Ashley!!: Yeah keep the heat in for sure
2016-12-14, 6:43 PM - Julian Stacey!: I checked to make sure it doesn't open enough for a person to fit through
2016-12-14, 6:43 PM - Julian Stacey!: But maybe a gremlin could
2016-12-14, 7:07 PM - Josh Power: Oooohhohoho man!
2016-12-14, 7:07 PM - Josh Power: Frig that
2016-12-14, 7:09 PM - Ashley!!: What about a small child
2016-12-14, 7:09 PM - Cole Basaraba: Oh man
2016-12-14, 7:09 PM - Ashley!!: What's with all these creepo houses lately
2016-12-14, 7:14 PM - Julian Stacey!: I think a child could
2016-12-14, 7:14 PM - Julian Stacey!: Oh god
2016-12-14, 7:14 PM - Ashley!!: Oh god
2016-12-14, 7:14 PM - Ashley!!: Wait does your employer know about this
2016-12-14, 7:15 PM - Ashley!!: WHOS HOUSE IS IT REALLY
2016-12-14, 7:15 PM - Ashley!!: I think you should leave
2016-12-14, 7:15 PM - Julian Stacey!: I don't think so. Me and one other guy are the first ones to stay here
2016-12-14, 7:16 PM - Julian Stacey!: It used to belong to some chief executive of the village or something
2016-12-14, 7:32 PM - Jacob Myth: Random thing. Everyone has android right?
2016-12-14, 7:32 PM - Ashley!!: Yes. FINALLY!
2016-12-14, 7:33 PM - Julian Stacey!: Yeah
2016-12-14, 7:33 PM - Jacob Myth: Random thing. Need face pics and voice clips from everyone.
2016-12-14, 7:34 PM - Julian Stacey!: What kind of voice clip?
2016-12-14, 7:34 PM - Jacob Myth: Whatever characterizes you. Haha.
2016-12-14, 7:35 PM - Jacob Myth: Friendsmas thing maybe. :/
2016-12-14, 7:38 PM - Peter Blackhat: So I have to say "Yeah for real" awesome.
2016-12-14, 7:38 PM - Peter Blackhat: Aren't I supposed to get a picture with my face mashed against a window for you, Jon?  I barely remember what Cole said.
2016-12-14, 7:43 PM - Nicole Gibson: Omg I'm so excited. Do you just want them sent over whatsapp?
2016-12-14, 7:46 PM - Jacob Myth: Hmm yea. Maybe I'll make a WhatsApp channel to keep them in one place. So hold em and post em there.
2016-12-15, 8:33 AM - Steph Curtis: We found out what's behind the door
2016-12-15, 8:33 AM - Steph Curtis: Its a sex dungeon for sure. A tire swing hanging from the ceiling and two big screen TVs. No windows and the locks on the door
2016-12-15, 8:37 AM - Peter Blackhat: Huzzah
2016-12-15, 8:41 AM - Steph Curtis: Sorry I messed up. Two tire swings chained to the ceiling and ONE TV
2016-12-15, 8:42 AM - Peter Blackhat: Tire swings are an odd choice for a sex dungeon.
2016-12-15, 8:42 AM - Steph Curtis: Maybe he likes the way hard rubber feels against his boooody
2016-12-15, 8:42 AM - Steph Curtis: Yuck
2016-12-15, 8:47 AM - Peter Blackhat: Did kind sound like the type.
2016-12-15, 8:58 AM - John Rustle: Hmm yeah that's definitely less crazy than I expected
2016-12-15, 8:59 AM - Ashley!!: Darn
2016-12-15, 9:07 AM - Steph Curtis: There were kids toys all over his house though
2016-12-15, 9:07 AM - Steph Curtis: Because it was a forced sale we looked at the listing
2016-12-15, 9:07 AM - John Rustle: Oh frig that makes it way worse
2016-12-15, 9:07 AM - John Rustle: Man. I hope the police did their due diligence on that one
2016-12-15, 9:08 AM - John Rustle: Can't think of any sex dungeon that locks from the outside...
2016-12-15, 9:15 AM - Steph Curtis: Same here. And he was suuuuper hesitant to give the key to it despite the police having a warrant
2016-12-15, 9:15 AM - Steph Curtis: And why would police be involved in the first place unless there was other shit going on?
2016-12-15, 9:16 AM - Josh Power: Eeeeeew
2016-12-15, 9:35 AM - Peter Blackhat: May justice prevail
